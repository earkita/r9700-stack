# Progress log

## 2026-10-01 (GLM FP8 plugin on stock vLLM, clean clone)

- Moved the validated sparse reader into a version-pinned, opt-in plugin
  adapter; installed vLLM files remain unchanged. Dispatch is scoped to
  gfx1201, GLM TP8, rope-free latent 512 and E4M3 KV. BF16 keeps upstream
  dispatch, and both reference images remain available.
- Built and launched from a fresh `git clone --no-local`, without host
  libraries. The first startup exposed an outer/text model-config mismatch;
  fixed in `99a63d1` with constructor and metadata dispatch regressions.
  The corrected image passed 86 GPU tests, 26 host tests, API checks and
  32/32 NIAH strict/retrieval/format/completion checks at T=0 and T=1.
- Bounded BetterBench C1 decode: 49.71 tok/s at 8K and 53.02 at 32K,
  versus historical source-patched FP8 55.71/54.92. Round time differs by
  less than 0.2%; observed acceptance is lower in these three-sample runs.
  No speedup or persistent regression claim. Full suite/soak remain deferred.
- The clean-clone service remains running, FP8 target / BF16 draft, K7,
  APC, 64K, HTTP 200, no runtime error matches in its full test log.
  Evidence: `notes/baselines/glm53-fp8-plugin-validation.json`.

## 2026-10-01 (opt-in GLM C1 W4A4 candidate)

- Extended the existing grouped HIP WMMA kernel to consume original Quark
  packed weights and per-group activation scales. Quark still performs MXFP4
  activation QDQ; the rounded values are transported losslessly through FP8
  operands. No full expert-weight BF16 materialization or checkpoint conversion.
  Upstream clamp=10, routing weights and output reduction are retained.
- Opt-in `R9K_GLM_MOE=w4a4`, pinned gfx1201 / GLM / TP8 / C1 / top-8 shapes;
  other calls use the original path. Twenty numerical/adapter/lifecycle cases
  pass, plus 11 existing CPU integration tests. The first API attempt failed
  because model config was queried outside its construction context; fixed in
  `3a1ba44`, with a regression test. Final API passes, both math answers are 23,
  both tool-call forms work, and an exact 128-token stream completes.
- Native BetterBench chat, 1 warmup + 3 measured requests per leg: median
  decode 5.0669 -> 9.0990 tok/s (1.796x), with the same 200/160/400 completion
  budgets. **Decode excludes TTFT/prefill.** Median TTFT 963.63 -> 329.39 ms.
  Preliminary sequential runs, not a full/thermally paired result; every
  measured request is budget-truncated, not an answer-quality result.
- Short target-32k prefill: 1 warmup + 2 measured, median actual input 23,508,
  TTFT 9060.1 ms, 2594.6 tok/s. Close to prior baseline, without a precise
  regression/speedup claim from these unequal sample sets.
- Profile confirms all 42 routed MoE layers use the new kernel: 84 expensive
  standalone dequant launches/step disappear. Remaining dequant 0.664–0.676 ms,
  new grouped WMMA including weight conversion 3.03–3.16 ms/step. RCCL/waiting
  and rank-dependent gaps dominate the instrumented trace now; host submission
  and synchronization need investigation before blaming transfer bandwidth.
- Evidence and checksums: `bench/results/glm-w4a4-candidate/`.
  Server `glm53-flash-w4a4-v2` remains running,
  bounded jobs are finished, full quality/concurrency/soak stay deferred.

## 2026-10-01 (GLM bounded profile review)

- Finished the short profile captured at 21:59 UTC on September 30. All eight
  traces contain 16 single-token decode steps and 2251 kernel launches/step.
  MXFP4 weight dequantization consumes 157.27–157.57 ms/step, or 81.89–82.44%
  of summed kernel time. Routed MoE GEMMs take 7.05–7.11 ms/step; RCCL kernels
  take 5.84–10.21 ms/step. Internal GPU gaps account for 4.69–5.21% of the span.
- Pinned emulation dequantizes all 288 experts before applying the selected
  top-8 IDs. First candidate is selected-expert dequantization for C1 while
  preserving upstream W4A4 semantics; not implemented or quality-validated.
  Kernel timings include profiler effects and are not a decode benchmark.
- Full decode/concurrency/GSM8K remain deferred. Saved all eight traces,
  checksums, per-rank summaries, request transcripts and server logs under
  ignored `bench/results/glm-5.3-flash-bringup/`; no performance optimization
  or speedup claim.

## 2026-09-30 (GLM-5.3-Flash bring-up)

- Added a structural GLM5Next/Quark preflight and a thin TP8 / 65536 / C1 profile
  over the existing launcher. Qwen defaults remain unchanged. Checkpoint revision
  `b5688f25491202978c19c4d036eef579f61bbe07`; pinned ROCm 10 vLLM `e97573215`.
- Audit: GLM uses dynamic **W4A4**, mixed FP8 block-128 overrides, sigmoid/top-8
  routing over 288 experts, clamped SwiGLU and an ungated shared expert.
  Existing Qwen W4A8/MoE/shared fusions are not drop-in replacements. Kept
  upstream loading, emulated Quark MoE, KDA/sparse MLA and RCCL; no performance
  optimization enabled.
- Stock attempt: all 62 shards load (21.33 GiB/rank), then the GLM indexer rejects
  gfx1201 via a CDNA-only AITER predicate. A scoped, version-guarded plugin proxy
  admits upstream's existing RDNA4 Triton dispatcher without enabling global CK
  paths or changing any attention kernel. With this adapter TP8 reaches API ready.
- Checks passed: 11 CPU integration tests, 17 pinned upstream sparse-dispatch
  tests and 2 GPU FP32 indexer-logit reference cases. Short API contract passes
  for reasoning/content, streaming, tool calls and JSON arguments. These are
  bounded checks, not full attention/MoE/model-level correctness evidence.
- **Baseline blocked:** verified 225 W on all eight GPUs, then ran BetterBench
  0.6.0 prefill. 2k/8k/16k stages complete; the first 32k-stage request triggers
  `HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_FAULT` across all ranks (19:46:23 UTC). No complete
  benchmark report, no 64k validation, no soak/quality/optimized A-B claim.
  Shutdown releases GPU memory but Docker cleanup stalls. Preserve this as a
  rejected baseline attempt; isolate the fault before proceeding to optimization.
- Docker cleanup recovered after about two minutes, without a daemon restart.
  Additional GPU references: 8 passed, 1 strict xfail for upstream Quark decoding
  reserved E8M0 code 255 as Inf rather than NaN. A full exported-scale scan finds
  only 117–128 in 36,414 uint8 scale tensors (9,545,711,616 bytes), so this
  checkpoint does not contain the problematic code. Full MoE/attention numerical
  equivalence remains unvalidated.
- Rejected reference: the first indexer comparison rounded GEMM output to BF16,
  unlike Triton's FP32 accumulation. Explicit FP32 reference passes at the same
  tolerance. No tolerance relaxation or numerical kernel change was made.
- **Long-context fault fixed:** synchronous HIP + Python stack sampling localize
  the write fault to GLM's kpool prefill cache writer. Upstream picks 640-token
  metadata blocks while storing 128-token pages; an unsplit block table is indexed
  as if split. A GLM-only backend declaration `[128, 256]` aligns token units,
  reusing existing metadata and kernels. Eight geometry regression cases pass.
  Replays of the failing 23,583-token input and an exact 64,000-token input both
  complete (16 output tokens), with temporary per-rank bounds checks passing.
  Bounds-check/synchronization code is removed from the shipping profile.
- Added two W4A4 expert-subset/reference cases and two sparse-MLA output cases,
  all passing at TP8 dimensions. Pinned upstream KDA/kpool tests at H=8 / kpool=4 /
  page=32: 26 pass, 1 CUDA-only skip. Unmodified kpool=16 fuzz seed 9 differs by
  one FP8 byte; retain that limitation rather than loosening its exact test.
- Started a fresh ordinary baseline after the cache fix. Formal BetterBench,
  long-generation soak and model-level quality results are still pending.
- Fresh baseline API contract passes, followed by the complete BetterBench
  prefill sweep (2 warmups + 8 measured requests at each of five depths), with
  no failed requests. Median prefill tok/s: 2094.6 / 2481.6 / 2611.6 / 2595.3 /
  2578.6 for target 2k / 8k / 16k / 32k / 64k. Actual median input lengths are
  1514 / 5892 / 11799 / 23548 / 47014 tokens; TTFT at the 32k label is 9070.5 ms.
  Eight samples do not establish p99. Started the 30-minute API soak; full
  20-pass decode, concurrency, quality and optimization A/B remain pending.
- **API soak passes:** 35 min 26 s, two cycles / 10 requests, including two
  4096-token generations and four correct tool calls. All math answers are 23;
  manual output review finds no obvious repetitive degeneration. No HIP/RCCL/
  OOM/engine errors or kernel GPU faults/resets; container remains running.
  This does not prove every internal activation finite.
- GPU 1 VRAM reaches its 108 C slowdown threshold, with lower core clocks than
  other ranks. Retained GPU telemetry covers the final ~8 minutes only: restarting
  amd-smi watch with `--append` overwrote the earlier CSV. Full server/API/CPU
  evidence remains. Record this limitation and repeat prefill in a warmed state
  after the running full 20-pass decode, without overwriting the original report.
- Queued separate NSEQ=16 concurrency, baseline profiling, and two full GSM8K C1
  runs with paired noise-floor comparison. No results or speedup claimed yet.
  Existing profiler analysis now measures overlapping intervals correctly and
  reports per-GPU launch counts (7 CPU tests pass). Optional evaluation response
  transcripts retain truncation/reasoning metadata without changing scoring.
- **Validation scope revised:** stopped the incomplete decode benchmark during
  the code category and disabled the long follow-up queue. Full concurrency and
  GSM8K are deferred; prioritize a bounded profile of the slow emulation path.
  Static source audit shows all 288 expert weights are dequantized each forward,
  although C1 routes to eight experts: 1.6875 GiB of BF16 temporaries per MoE
  layer/rank, or 70.875 GiB over 42 MoE layers per token/rank. This is a source-
  derived volume estimate, not a measured time breakdown. A separate profiler
  instance starts with copied compilation cache; numerical runtime unchanged.

## 2026-09-18 (overnight session)

### Findings
- **P2P gives ~nothing at TP2 on Flash-Next** (clean A/B, same flags): single 69.7 vs 69.5 tok/s, agg within noise.
  Expert offload over PCIe dominates, not all-reduce. (bench/ab-p2p.log, bench/ab-nop2p.log)
- **Host->GPU link on the .100 box is PCIe Gen3** behind PLX PEX 8747 switches: 14 GB/s per GPU, 27.8 GB/s both.
  A Gen4 CPU-direct box roughly doubles it.
- **Kernel ablation of tcclaviger/vllm:dev** (ablation/run-ablation.sh; results ablation/summary.tsv):
  see table below. `clav_attn` is dead weight for this model (Triton attention equal); `fp8hip`, QSA r4d kernels,
  GDN HIP and the clav glue kernels each matter 5-13%.
- **Public prior art found**: davetha/r9700-lru-expert-cache (Apache-2.0: device-side LRU expert cache kernels +
  tests, 93-139 tok/s single-stream on the same 2x R9700 + model) and StillDeadcode/libr4d (gfx1201 GEMMs, AR,
  GDN; no license yet). The only truly private hard kernels are tcclaviger's MoE grouped GEMM and QSA sparse
  attention. Notes: notes/kernel-inventory.md, notes/ggz14-libr4d-review.md, notes/tcclaviger-fork-analysis.md,
  notes/upstream-0.29-rocm10.md.
- **Stock target exists**: `vllm/vllm-openai-rocm:nightly-rocm100-<sha>` = vLLM main + torch 2.12 rocm10 +
  triton 3.8 + hipcc, gfx1201 wheels. Pinned dee37d89.

### Built (all in this repo, compiled for gfx1201 with the image's hipcc, hostcall-free)
- `kernels/r9k_moe_mxfp4a8.hip` — grouped MXFP4 x FP8 MoE GEMM (derived from libr4d's dense kernel: fragment-order
  weights, folded-exponent unpack, fp8 WMMA, in-block split-K), MoE routing via vLLM's moe_align_block_size
  output, router weight folded in the epilogue, MT=1/2/4 M-tiles per block for prefill. + per-row fp8 quant.
- `kernels/r9k_ple.hip` — PLE int6 fused-row gather+dequant (reads the table from pinned host memory via UVA).
- `kernels/third_party/davetha/r4d_lru.hip` — vendored LRU expert cache kernels (Apache-2.0).
- `r9700_vllm/` plugin (vllm.general_plugins entry point), all hooks ROCm-gfx12-only and idempotent:
  - `moe/ct_mxfp4.py` — compressed-tensors MXFP4 MoE -> our experts (stock picks CUDA-only Marlin); in-place,
    UVA-aware weight re-layout.
  - `moe/experts.py` — `R9700Mxfp4Experts` (vLLM modular experts class).
  - `moe/cache.py` — per-layer VRAM slot arena + UVA host store + LRU (davetha kernels), warm start from the
    checkpoint's routing profile; two-pass hot/cold GEMM. `R9K_EXPERT_CACHE_GB` per rank.
  - `ple/int6.py` — int6 PLE table in pinned host memory (UVA) instead of stock's bf16-in-VRAM (51 GB/rank).
  - `linear/mxfp4.py` — dense MXFP4 linears (shared experts) on our kernel instead of per-call dequant emulation.
  - `spec/mtp_rocm.py` — MTP k>1 on ROCm (QSA metadata onto the spec-decode allowlist, cf. PR #55292).
- `docker/Dockerfile` (stock nightly + plugin), `serve/serve.sh` (was serve-stock-fn.sh), `bench/bringup-tests.sh`,
  `tests/` (MoE GEMM vs exact dequant, PLE vs reference, cache bit-identity + LRU invariants).

### Stock vLLM (ROCm 10 nightly) + plugin: bring-up and tuning log (2026-09-18 morning)
All unit tests pass on gfx1201 (MoE GEMM, PLE, cache bit-identity + LRU invariants, fp8 GEMM exactness).
Bring-up fixes needed (all in the plugin / launcher, no vLLM source patches):
- hostcall-free RCCL rebuilt IN the nightly image + hostcall-patched vLLM _rocm_C/_C_stable_libtorch (emulated switch)
- CT: fp8 groups inherit global `mxfp4-pack-quantized` format -> set float-quantized; `weight_scale_inv` -> `weight_scale`;
  drop fork q/k/v scales + fork MTP q4 head; MTP MLP fp8 block-128 can't shard 640/2 -> re-quantized to MXFP4 at load
- torch pinned memory rounds to 2^k (OOM) -> hipHostRegister exact-size pinning (PLE, cache, stock UVA offload)
- `--language-model-only` (ViT SDPA hipErrorInvalidValue on gfx1201/torch 2.12)
- stock CT W4A4 asks kMxfp4Dynamic -> our dense kernel must accept it (else per-call emulation)
- **HSA_ENABLE_IPC_MODE_LEGACY=0** (nightly sets 1 -> hipIpcGetMemHandle fails -> no P2P)
- **GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES=1**: cross-stream waits inside HIP graphs were stalling ~50x/step (129 -> 25 ms ITL at bs1)
- libr4d 2-rank P2P all-reduce instead of RCCL (69 us -> ~3 us per call); vLLM's own custom AR = garbage on gfx1201

Prefill investigation (2026-09-18 pm): warm prefill ~1,550 tok/s @2k, ~2,050 @8k-31k. Profile of a 31k prompt:
43% of GPU time is expert gathers at ~14.5 GB/s = the Gen3 link. Every 4096-token chunk routes to nearly all 512
experts/layer, so all ~240 non-resident experts cross PCIe once per chunk. Staging cold experts into VRAM
(R9K_STAGE_COLD=1, bit-exact, tested) removes duplicate reads but gives no measurable prefill gain; bigger chunks do
(NBT=8192 + 240 slots: +25% @31k, +11% @8k, -10% @2k, KV only 43k tokens) -> trade-off, not default.
Real prefill fixes: Gen4 host link (~2x), more VRAM for experts (4 cards), or CPU-side compute of rarely-hit experts.
BENCH CAVEAT: bench.py runs are single-shot and confounded by compile-cache state (servers that loaded a cached
AOT graph (140 s startup) ran @4 at ~182 tok/s; fresh-compile starts (~470 s) ran ~118-121 with the same code).
Need a repeated-run harness before trusting <15% differences.

Launch (defaults now in serve/serve.sh, MTP=3 default): `OVERLAYS=emulated-switch serve/serve.sh` then `python3 ~/warmup.py`
(= OFFLOAD_GB=34, UTIL=0.94, R9K_EXPERT_CACHE_SLOTS=270, fp8 target+draft LM heads). 320 slots leaves no KV room.
Opt-ins measured and left off: R9K_FP8_BLOCK=rowwise|block (acceptance drop / ~1 ms), R9K_FP8_LINEARS=hyper_connection
(acceptance drop), R9K_DRAFT_LMHEAD=mxfp4 (throughput +, single -).

Remaining gaps: short-prompt prefill (host read-through of offloaded experts over Gen3 PCIe), LRU miss traffic
(~7.5 ms/step), untuned Triton fp8-block GEMMs (~4.7 ms/step); VM100 RAM upgrade would allow a full cache.
Correction: the "+ fp8 HC linears" row above ran on a stale torch.compile cache that still used the bf16 HC path
(Dynamo cannot trace our ctypes kernels; they are now torch custom ops, and the compile cache is keyed by R9K_* knobs):
that gain is the fp8 LM heads alone. With fp8 HC + row-wise fp8 block projections truly active: 58.5 single, MTP
acceptance 2.64 (vs ~3.0) -> worse; being A/B'd separately.
Correction: the earlier "P2P gives nothing" A/B was flawed (tcclaviger's r4d AR kept using P2P IPC in both arms).

### 2026-09-18 afternoon: extension points, overlay split, harness, NVFP4
- **Plugin on official extension points** (a529442): `R9kCompressedTensorsConfig` registered over
  "compressed-tensors"; `ModelRegistry` subclasses for Qwen4Exp CG/CausalLM/MTP; `R9700Platform` via
  `vllm.platform_plugins` -> `R9kCommunicator` (libr4d AR). One class patch left (MTP allowlist, version-gated).
  `tests/test_integration.py` covers every hook. Gate (MTP-3, TP2): 203.9 tok/s @8, 189.0 @16, prefill 8k 2727 tok/s,
  GSM8K 98/100, needle 3/3 -- parity with pre-refactor.
- **Overlay split** (cbffc52): `overlay/emulated-switch/` (hostcall-free RCCL, vLLM .so hostcall patcher, scanners),
  `serve/serve.sh` stock by default, `OVERLAYS=emulated-switch` on VM100. MTP=3 now the default.
- **Harness**: `bench/harness.py` (nonce prompts, streamed TTFT vs decode, repeats -> median/spread) + `bench/ab.sh`
  (interleaved A/B with restarts).
- **NVFP4**: (a) load-time NVFP4->MXFP4 conversion (dense + MoE; exact dequant, 2-candidate E8M0 search). Weight error
  sits at the double-rounding floor, ~1.55x NVFP4's own (synthetic: 0.095 -> 0.149). Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4: GSM8K-200
  96.5% (GGZ14's conversion run on 09-16: 97.0%), decode 29.7 tok/s, 8-conc 210.7 tok/s.
  (b) native NVFP4 kernel variant (`r9k_moe_nvfp4a8`, template NV): WMMA on unscaled e2m1, per-(row, 16-K) e4m3 scale
  applied to the partial (8 FMAs/WMMA), per-row global in the epilogue -- exact weights; default for dense NVFP4
  (`R9K_NVFP4=native|mxfp4`). NVFP4 MoE layers still convert (expert cache carries MXFP4-layout scales).

### 2026-09-19/20: Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4 speed work (target: GGZ14 radiance on the same box)

**Baseline discipline.** `~/bb-prod.log` (181.5 combined) is the PRODUCTION box (192.168.0.155, Quark MXFP4) --
not comparable. The same-box GGZ14 radiance NVFP4 baseline is `~/bb-full.log` (2026-09-16) and a 2026-09-19 rerun:
**combined decode 196.5 t/s, conc 177/294/428/549, update p50 23.5 ms, TTFT 65 ms, prefill ~4.8k t/s**, GSM8K 97.0,
HumanEval 98.2. Always check `results.json` `env.endpoint` before quoting a number.

**Our 27B config** (serve/serve.sh): `R9K_AR_QUANT=1 VLLM_KV_CACHE_LAYOUT=LBHNC KVMEM=9 R9K_BF16_TO_MXFP4=in_proj_ba

Quality: GSM8K-200 96.5-97.0%, HumanEval 96.3%, 8/8 concurrent sanity answers.

**What moved the needle, in order:** speculative decoding (drafter fp8 dequant fix in models/dflash.py), the chat
template (acceptance: code 3.34 -> 4.49 tok/step), libr4d prefill attention (2413 -> 93 ms per 9k prompt), the
large-M GEMM (68-84 -> 117-142 TFLOPS), split-KV verify attention, fp8->MXFP4 requant, wht6 all-reduce.

**Measured dead ends:** unpadded drafter batch + sync scheduling (needs GGZ14's vLLM patch; 29.1 ms/step on stock);
drafter in W4 (-0.5 ms/step but -7% acceptance); LDS-staged A for the decode kernel (never wins once its gate is
correct); NT loads on MT>1 (Flash-Next prefill -24%); fp8->MXFP4 on Flash-Next (no gain, it is expert-traffic bound).

**Flash-Next on the same code:** decode 81 / conc-8 206 / prefill 2046, MTP acceptance 2.69 -- unchanged or better
at every step (the prefill GEMM gave conc-8 +13%).

**Gotchas found the hard way:** vLLM's memory profile underestimates once load-time requant/merges are on (use
KVMEM=); a stale `tuned.json` sync silently reverted the M=32/64 rows; LDS-A with WV=1,MT=4 staged half its tile
(NaN at batch 64) -- tests/test_tuned_cfgs.py now gates every tuned row.


**FINAL BetterBench 2026-09-20** (20 passes, same box, same settings as the GGZ14 baseline), ours vs GGZ14:

Flash-Next on the same build: single 84.5, conc-8 206, prefill 2165, MTP acceptance 2.75 (all >= its pre-week numbers).

**Remaining prefill gap is GEMM only** (9k prompt, GPU-busy): ours 1361 ms / 768 calls vs GGZ14 930 ms / 484;
all-reduce 373 vs 360, attention 92 vs 58, glue comparable. Their edge: activations arrive WMMA-fragment-tiled
(256 B per 16x16 fp8 fragment) from their fused norm+quant, so their GEMM never stages A through LDS.

### 2026-09-20 evening: fragment-tiled activations (closes most of the prefill GEMM gap)

The prefill GEMM now takes its activation in WMMA-fragment layout (`r9k_quant_rows_fp8_tiled`: fragment (mt, ks)
= 256 contiguous bytes, lane l holding A[mt*16 + l%16][ks*16 + (l/16)*8 .. +8]) and loads each A fragment with one
SADDR `global_load_b64` straight into the register the WMMA consumes -- no LDS A slab, no per-fragment `ds_read`,
no staging stores, LDS down from 2x26 KB to 2x8 KB on the 256x128 tile. The quantizer writes that layout instead
of row-major at the same cost (+/-1%), so it is a re-layout and not an extra pass. W keeps the pass-3 folded
unpack through LDS. Output is bit-identical to the folded LDS-A kernel (same accumulation order), gated by
`tests/test_atiled_4bit.py`. Dense path only: `pick_cfg(..., fold=True) -> ("A", cfg)` at M >= 128 when
`R9K_ATILED=1` (default on), folded MXFP4, K % BK == 0 and K <= 20480; everything else keeps the LDS-A tiles.

Kernel-level (min of 5 interleaved, warmed): 0.74-0.92x of the tuned folded tile across the five served 27B
shapes at M 128-4096, i.e. ~150 -> 175-215 TF/s. Served, 27B, three probes per leg on two independent server
starts (cv < 0.1%):

| prompt | `R9K_ATILED=0` | `R9K_ATILED=1` | gain |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8.97k tok | 3936 tok/s (2281 ms) | **4434 tok/s** (2021 ms) | **+12.7%** |
| 20.7k tok | 3772 tok/s (5477 ms) | **4209 tok/s** (4919 ms) | **+11.6%** |

So 9k prefill is now **~93% of same-box GGZ14** (4776-4950), up from ~79%. Decode is untouched, as the M >= 128
gate implies: single 113.2/116.4 (on) vs 115.2/118.7 (off), conc-8 483.6 vs 483.8, GSM8K-500 96.40% both legs;
Flash-Next unchanged (84.6 / 205.1 / prefill 2151 / accept 2.73). A first conc-8 pair read 472.6 vs 503.8 with
non-overlapping ranges at n=2 -- re-measured on fresh servers it was 483.6 vs 483.8, i.e. run-to-run noise, which
is what the code says it must be (`pick_atiled` returns None below M=128, so the decode path is byte-identical).

Routed MoE deliberately not converted: those GEMMs are weight/L2-stream bound (gate_up moves the 420 MB expert set
at 397 GB/s), so a gather+tile pass would add ~25% of the weight traffic to a kernel whose A staging is not the
limit. Argued, not measured -- the kernel already accepts sorted-position tiled A, only the producer is missing.

**The 768-vs-484 launch-count gap was not apples to apples.** GGZ14 chunks at 8192 (2 chunks on a 9k prompt to our
3 at NBT=4096) and keeps MLP layers 56-63 on fp8, while `R9K_FP8_TO_MXFP4=1` converts them -- so their 930 ms
excluded 16 GEMMs per chunk that ours included. Untried from this: `NBT=8192` (check the libr4d AR max message
size at 8192x5120x2 = 80 MiB) and leaving layers 56-63 on the fp8 kernel.

### 2026-09-21: independence from libr4d (see notes/independence.md)

Both runtime dependencies replaced by our own kernels: paged attention (`kernels/r9k_attn.hip`, now the default)
and the 2-rank all-reduce (`kernels/r9k_ar.hip` + `r9k_ar_wht.hip`, `R9K_AR_IMPL=r9k`). A fully libr4d-free 27B
runs at **~11% below prefill and ~4% below decode** with identical GSM8K-500, against -55% prefill if the
dependency were simply dropped. Attention alone is 99.8% of libr4d; the whole remaining gap is the all-reduce.

**Prefill knobs measured and rejected** (both fell out of the finding that the "768 vs 484 GEMM launches" gap was
never apples to apples -- GGZ14 chunk at 8192 and keep MLP layers 56-63 on fp8):
- `NBT=8192`: no gain at 9k (4395 vs 4392) and the engine dies with HTTP 500 at a 20.7k prompt. Rejected.
- `R9K_FP8_TO_MXFP4=0` (keep layers 56-63 on fp8): prefill 3456 vs 4392 (-21%), decode 94.7 vs 115.1, step
  30.7 vs 25.1 ms. Much worse -- converting those layers is a clear win and the existing default is right.

### 2026-09-21: TTFT investigated and closed

101 ms vs the reference stack's 65 ms. Decomposed to **~80 ms fixed + 0-25 ms step-boundary wait**; the fixed part
is prefill (queue time 0.0 ms, prefill time ~78 ms for an *8-token* prompt), and prefill runs **eager**: 32.2 ms
GPU busy against ~78 ms wall, ~1,950 launches at ~24 us of gap each. `cudagraph_mode` already defaults to
FULL_AND_PIECEWISE so those launches survive capture; `FULL` is 55 ms *worse*. Ruled out by measurement:
speculative decoding (helps by 37 ms), chat-template rendering, HSA_ENABLE_MWAITX, GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES, the API
server. Closed as upstream behaviour -- full detail and the one remaining lever in notes/picking-up.md.
(**Reopened and root-caused 2026-10-02**, below: the eager launches were stock's chunked GDN prefill core, 48 times
a step. Not upstream behaviour we had to accept.)

Added `CGMODE=` and `MWAITX=` knobs to serve/serve.sh while investigating.

### 2026-09-22: power cap is a fixed condition, not a knob

Raising the 225 W cap is closed permanently. Every reference measurement (libr4d, GGZ14) was taken at 225 W, so
uncapping ours would invalidate the comparison in the same way the `bb-prod.log` baseline mix-up did; and Brian
runs capped in production, so an uncapped number is one he would never see. Prefill being clock-limited at
2.40 GHz is therefore a property of the target, not an opportunity.

**Measurement discipline (learned the hard way this week):**
- ALWAYS check `results.json` `env.endpoint` before quoting a baseline: ~/bb-prod.log is the PRODUCTION box.
- Never start a run while another is live (two servers on the same GPUs produced 30% CVs and nonsense numbers);
  `pgrep -f "[g]sm8k|[b]atch|[q]fn"` + `docker ps` before starting.
- Cold single-shot kernel timings overstate by ~15%: the card sits at 2.2-2.4 GHz / 222 W under sustained load
  (decode sees 2.82 GHz). Use tuning/prefill_ab.py (warmed, interleaved).
- GSM8K-500 CANNOT separate these configs: six runs scatter 95.6-97.4% with no consistent ordering. Quality claims
  need several thousand questions or a different eval.
- conc-8 (`agg8_tok_s`) at n=2 can separate identical builds by 6% with non-overlapping ranges: the prefill-probe
  words are ~6.9 tokens each (`w<random>`), so WORDS=1300 is the ~9k-token prompt and WORDS=6000 exceeds the 32k
  context and 400s. Before believing a decode delta, ask whether the code even has a path to it, then re-measure.
- Kernel gates that call the inner op miss served-path breakage: exercise r9700_vllm/ops.py's public wrappers too.
- `DRYRUN=1` only prints the assembled docker command: it does NOT source the overlays, so a launcher missing
  `OVERLAYS=` passes DRYRUN and then fails at startup. serve/27b.sh and serve/flashnext.sh shipped that way and
  every RCCL collective died with HIP "the operation cannot be performed in the present state" at enqueue.cc:2119
  (comm init completes, single-GPU compute is fine, all transports fail alike) -- the signature of the stock,
  hostcall-carrying RCCL on the .100 PLX box. Both launchers now default `OVERLAYS=${OVERLAYS-emulated-switch}`.
  A new launcher is not verified until it has actually served a request.
### 2026-09-23: 45+48 on one PLX switch, switch-local P2P, and what routing costs in serving
Third card installed; VM100 now runs **45 + 48, both on the same PEX 8747** (was 45 + c6 on separate switches).
Host work is in `host/README.md`: a second card on one switch gets no BAR0 without `r9700_chainfix` (DKMS), and
peer traffic only stays in the switch with ACS redirect off **and** guest GPU addresses equal to host addresses.
- Synthetic, 45<->48 at 256 MB: both-ways peer copy 12.74 -> **25.26 GB/s**; RCCL all-reduce busbw 5.09 -> 10.08.
- **Full BetterBench 20-pass, `serve/27b.sh` (switch-local P2P) vs the 2026-09-22 baseline (45 + c6): parity.**
  Step 24.4 ms both; conc 166/280/379/510 vs 166/270/394/521; prefill 4,123/4,153/4,048/3,812 vs
  4,099/4,143/4,043/3,809 (2k/8k/16k/32k); per-category decode all within noise (`betterbench compare`).
- **Live A/B on one running server, ACS redirect off / on / off** (`host/acsab.sh`; prefill sweep + quick decode):

| | pf 2k | pf 8k | pf 16k | pf 32k | step p50 | step p99 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| switch-local (off) | 4,167 | 4,187 | 4,070 | 3,821 | 24.47 ms | 26.62 ms |
| **via CPU (on)** | **3,741** | **3,770** | **3,683** | **3,491** | **25.29 ms** | **27.37 ms** |
| switch-local (off, repeat) | 4,121 | 4,149 | 4,047 | 3,810 | 24.49 ms | 26.50 ms |

  Routing peer traffic through the CPU costs **9-10% prefill and +3.3% decode step time**; the repeat arm
  returns to within ~1%, so it is not drift. Decode tok/s medians moved with speculative acceptance (199/200/203)
  and are not the signal here; step time is. No IOMMU/AER faults in any arm. Raw results: `~/bb0923/` on VM100.
- So two cards per switch cost nothing **only** with switch-local routing. For 4 cards on two switches the
  in-bank hops need it too, which means matching guest addresses for both banks in one VM (not yet solved:
  OVMF packs its 64-bit window contiguously and the two banks' host apertures are ~0.5 TB apart).
- Correction carried forward: the 2026-09-18 Flash-Next "P2P gives nothing" A/B is invalid (P2P IPC in both arms).

### 2026-09-24: Flash-Next at TP=4 on four cards (target: tcclaviger 29.04.4 on the same box)

Rob's published Flash-Next TP4/MTP4 run (163.8 BetterBench decode, 687 @16, 7.2k prefill) is on his hardware; his
image on OUR box (`~/serve-rob-tp4.sh`, hostcall-patched copies in `~/p2p-patched-2904`) is the real target. All
numbers below are the 1-minute probe (`~/probe.py`: 4 mixed prompts greedy / conc 8 and 16 / one 8.7k prefill);
BetterBench is reserved for a finalist. Step time is single-request MTP-3 (`~/tp4tune.sh` step.txt).

| config | step ms | dec 1 | c8 | c16 | prefill 8k |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| ours, start of day (TP=4, RCCL all-reduce, stock QSA) | 28.1 | -- | 299* | 508* | 3,767* |
| + our 4-rank P2P all-reduce | 22.9 | 140 | 299 | 508 | 3,767 |
| + our QSA sparse attention | 22.9 | 139 | 479 | 770 | 4,689 |
| + hybrid block-fp8 + mxfp4 heads + fused qk-norm/rope | **21.6** | **148** | **501** | **770** | **4,688** |
| Rob's image (29.04.4, MTP-4, fp8 KV, expert offload) | 20.8 | 169 | 503 | 769 | 6,446 |

(*) measured after the all-reduce change; the RCCL baseline's probe was not run.

- **N-rank P2P all-reduce** (`kernels/r9k_ar.hip` `r9k_ar_oneshot_nrank` / `r9k_ar_twoshot_nrank`, `comm/r9k_ar.py`
  `R9kAllReduceN`, installed for TP>2): one-shot <= 16 KB, two-shot <= 512 KB, RCCL above. Graph-timed at 20 KB
  11 us vs RCCL 73; 320 KB 73 vs 102. Decode step 28.1 -> 22.9 ms. At prefill sizes (20 MB) the exact two-shot
  loses to RCCL's ring (4.05 vs 2.97 ms even at 256 blocks): the all-to-all push saturates the inter-switch uplink.
  Only compression or a topology-aware schedule would win there; parked.
- **Our QSA sparse attention** (`kernels/r9k_qsa.hip`, `attn/qsa.py`, bound per layer; `R9K_QSA=stock` reverts).
  Reformulation: a row's selection is a union of whole 4-token groups plus the causal tail, so each row becomes a
  bitmap over groups and a tile of 16 rows walks the UNION of its groups, staging K/V once per tile (the stock
  Triton kernel gathers ~2 MB per row per layer). Bit-for-bit the same attended set; fp32 online softmax either
  way. 3.6x on the 12k prefill chunk (14.0 -> 3.9 ms), 13x on a 4k prefill, 2.4x decode; `tests/test_qsa_r9k.py`.
  Bug found on the way and worth remembering: a row that has met no valid key yet (m = -inf) riding along another
  row's rescale computes exp2(-inf - -inf) = NaN; impossible in causal attention (every row sees key 0 first),
  routine in QSA. Guarded.
- **Decode profile, ours vs Rob (torch profiler, `~/step-audit.py` per-layer):** GPU time per layer is at parity
  (415 vs 462 us, his including ~62 us of host expert streaming); we launch 78 kernels per layer to his 37. Enabling
  stock's fused qk-norm/rope Triton kernel on ROCm (`R9K_FUSED_QKROPE`, off in stock only because of an
  `is_cuda()` check; `tests/test_fused_qk_rope.py`) removed ~30 launches per QSA layer for ~0.06 ms/step: launch
  count is worth far less than assumed. The remaining eager glue is the indexer's norm + rope; not worth fusing.
- **Knobs that paid:** `R9K_FP8_BLOCK=block` (exact block scales, our split-K GEMM) at decode widths with stock's
  Triton kernel above M=64 (`R9K_FP8_BLOCK_MAXM`); the dispatch lives INSIDE a custom op (`r9700.fp8_block_dispatch`,
  layer registry keyed by registration index) because a Python branch on M in compiled code is resolved once at the
  M=4096 profile pass and then serves decode with the wrong kernel, and because `id(layer)` baked into the AOT
  artifact differs per rank process. mxfp4 LM heads (`R9K_TARGET_LMHEAD` / `R9K_DRAFT_LMHEAD`) halve the head's bytes.
- **Knobs that did not:** MTP-4 (acceptance up, step +1.7 ms, net loss); fp8 or mxfp4 for the hyper-connection
  mixers (latency-bound at these sizes; the merged down+inject matrix is 324 rows and fails the %16 check anyway);
  MoE decode config sweep for TP=4 shapes (`tuning/decode_moe_sweep.py`: served configs within 2-11% of best;
  gate_up now keyed by N in `moe/experts.py`); fp8 KV is refused by stock QSA ("requires a BF16 main KV cache").
- **Quality gate** (`bench/eval.py`, 300 GSM8K, conc=1): reference 96.0% vs candidate 97.0%, McNemar p=0.51, sanity
  8/8 both. Long-chain paired eval still to run before the candidate becomes the default.
- **vLLM 0.30** (`nightly-rocm100-e975732`, torch 2.12): whole stack runs unchanged (`r9700/vllm:dev030`,
  `~/p2p-patched-030`); probe at parity with the 0.29-era nightly.
- **Full BetterBench (20 passes), final default vs Rob's image, same box:** decode 125.1 vs 134.1; step p50 21.22
  vs 20.44 ms; TTFT p50 137 vs 145 ms; prefill 2,853 / 4,637 / 4,701 / 4,614 vs 5,279 / 5,711 / 5,977 / 6,106
  (2k / 8k / 16k / 32k); concurrency 117 / 193 / 283 / 374 / 478 vs 126 / 197 / 303 / 427 / 542 (1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16).
  The greedy probe overstated concurrency parity (-12% under sampling); short prefill (2k) is the worst ratio.
- **2k prefill profile (2,142 tokens, rank 0): our all-reduce is 387 ms of 671 ms GPU time (222 RCCL calls at
  1.73 ms for 11 MB messages); Rob's 116 ms (0.58 ms per call, compressed two-shot).** Everything else is within
  ~50 ms of his. The short-prefill 2x is the all-reduce alone.
- Prefill gap that remains (12.7k tokens, rank 0): all-reduce 1,019 ms (RCCL) vs Rob's 607 (compressed two-shot);
  attention now ~250 vs his 159; MoE/dense/elementwise ~180 ms combined.

### 2026-09-25: compressed hierarchical all-reduce, vLLM 0.30 default

- **Base image switched to the vLLM 0.30 nightly** (`nightly-rocm100-e975732`, torch 2.12). Final-config probe on
  it: 21.60 ms/step, 148.0 / 484 / 752 / 4,685 -- identical to the dee37d89 image. On VM100 `r9700/vllm:dev` is now
  the 0.30 build (old image kept as `dev-0918`), `~/p2p-patched-nightly` links to the 0.30 patched extensions.
- **`kernels/r9k_ar4.hip` + `comm/r9k_ar4.py`: the all-reduce from notes/ar4-plan.md.** Hierarchical 2x2 over the
  switch pairs, Walsh-Hadamard 4/6-bit wire fused into the push kernels (two elements per lane; no LDS in the
  transform), rotated-domain sums, seven launches, four handshakes, bit-identical outputs on all ranks.
  `tests/test_ar4.py` (torchrun, 4 ranks): PASS at 4 and 6 bits, graph replay interleaved with the exact kernels.

| message | RCCL | ar4 4-bit | ar4 6-bit | exact two-shot |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 1 MB | 204 us | 118 | 143 | 222 |
| 5 MB | 773 | 371 | 495 | 1,194 |
| 11 MB | 1,640 | **739** | 1,009 | 2,723 |
| 21 MB | 3,107 | **1,352** | 1,863 | -- |

  Rob's kernel: ~580 / ~1,200 us at 11 / 21 MB. Relative RMS error on a heavy-tailed input: 0.12 (4-bit), 0.027
  (6-bit); an already-quantised input round-trips to bf16 rounding.
- **Serving (Flash-Next TP=4 probe):** 8k prefill 4,685 -> **5,621 tok/s with 4-bit (+20%)**, 5,319 with 6-bit;
  decode 147-149, c8 497-506, c16 738-768 -- unchanged within noise. Prefill is now 87% of Rob's image (from 73%).
- **Quality (300 GSM8K, conc=1, same image):** default 96.67% vs 4-bit 96.00%, discordant 4/2, McNemar p=0.69: no
  detectable difference. The 800-question chain-of-thought paired eval decides whether R9K_AR4 becomes the default
  (opt-in `R9K_AR4=1` until then; `R9K_AR4_BITS=6` is the conservative wire).

### 2026-09-25 (cont.): the short-prefill floor, root-caused

BetterBench 2k prefill was 2,779 tok/s against Rob's 5,279 while 8k+ was within 3-8%. A TTFT-vs-length sweep
(`~/pfsweep.py`) showed TTFT quantized: ~285 ms for anything up to ~700 tokens, ~563 ms for 1.3k-3.1k tokens
regardless of length, then linear at ~5,650 tok/s. Two mechanisms, found with the torch profiler's CPU-side trace:

- **The prefill forward pass is CPU-bound at ~285 ms.** For a 672-token prefill the CPU issued ops for 407 of the
  426 ms span: 20,230 CPU ops per forward (compiled-graph pieces 267 ms, MoE Python 96, GDN 77, 351 unquantized
  GEMM dispatches 54, 101 all-reduces 32). Decode hides this behind cudagraphs; prefill runs the compiled graph
  eagerly. The rank skew this creates is what the all-reduce kernels spin on (ar4_pack_push at 498 us per call in
  the profile against ~40 us in the bench). Rob's stack has the same floor: his linear rate is 5,711 tok/s.
- **Prompts were split at the mamba block size.** With prefix caching on (default), the hybrid model runs the mamba
  cache in "align" mode and vLLM's scheduler aligns every chunk end to the mamba block size, so a 1,302-token prompt
  ran as two forward passes (202 all-reduces, 98 MoE calls, 26 QSA calls: exactly 2x the 672-token run), each paying
  the CPU floor. `--mamba-block-size` is ignored in align mode.

Fixes measured (TTFT, tokens -> ms): 1,325: 563 -> 313; 2,166: 564 -> 373; 3,086: 564 -> 512 (6,022 tok/s).

| | before | `--block-size 4096` | **`--no-enable-prefix-caching`** |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| 1,325 tokens | 563 ms | 296 | 313 |
| 3,086 tokens | 564 ms | 510 | 512 |
| KV cache capacity | 296k tokens | 99k (mamba pages padded 9x) | 296k |

`serve/flashnext.sh` now defaults `PREFIX_CACHE=0` (serve.sh knob; `=1` restores prefix reuse across requests --
a serving-behaviour change, flagged to Brian). **Full BetterBench of this default:** decode 125.1, step p50 21.12 ms,
TTFT 144 ms, prefill 5,267 / 5,702 / 5,723 / 5,530 (2k / 8k / 16k / 32k), concurrency 116 / 190 / 277 / 370 / 463.
Prefill is at parity with Rob's image through 8k (5,279 / 5,711) and 4-9% behind at 16-32k; decode -7%, concurrency
-13..-15% under sampling remain. Removing the CPU floor itself (capturing prefill chunks in cudagraphs
at 1024/2048/4096) is being measured; it is what would pass Rob at short prompts.

### 2026-09-25: final default and where it stands

Default now: our QSA attention, N-rank + compressed (4-bit) all-reduce, hybrid block-fp8, mxfp4 LM heads, fused
qk-norm/rope, prefix caching off, prefill cudagraphs to 2048 tokens, vLLM 0.30. Full 20-pass BetterBench, same box
and checkpoint as Rob's image (tcclaviger 29.04.4, MTP-4, fp8 KV, expert offload):

| | ours (2026-09-24 morning) | **ours now** | Rob's image |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| decode score | 125.1 | 125.0 | 134.1 |
| step p50 | 21.22 ms | 21.15 ms | 20.44 ms |
| TTFT p50 | 137 ms | **104 ms** | 145 ms |
| prefill 2k / 8k / 16k / 32k | 2,853 / 4,637 / 4,701 / 4,614 | **5,106 / 5,624 / 5,726 / 5,532** | 5,279 / 5,711 / 5,977 / 6,106 |
| concurrency 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 | 117 / 193 / 283 / 374 / 478 | **118 / 197 / 292 / 433 / 543** | 126 / 197 / 303 / 427 / 542 |

Concurrency at parity, TTFT 28% better, prefill within 1.5-9%, single-stream decode 7% behind (his MTP-4 vs our
MTP-3). The same full run with MTP-4: decode 130.5, step p50 22.48 ms, concurrency 122 / 197 / 294 / 402 / 466 --
+4.4% single-stream for -14% at 16 concurrent, so MTP-3 stays the default and `MTP=4` is the single-stream knob. Every lossy default passed two null paired evals at
conc=1 (300 short-answer, 800 chain-of-thought); the served config's sanity check passes.

### 2026-09-28: QSA indexer scoring kernel (r9k_qsa_score)

The 4k-chunk profile of 2026-09-25 (final stack vs Rob, `~/chain-pf4k.out`) put our GPU-busy at 731 ms vs his 625:
all-reduce 149 vs 200 (ours now faster), MoE 177 vs 141, elementwise 161 vs 97, QSA 96 vs 46. The QSA gap was
one kernel: vLLM's Triton `_qsa_mqa_paged_kernel` (indexer scoring) at 80 ms per chunk, 43 calls x 1.85 ms. It
launches a program per (row, 32 columns) over the whole context capacity, re-reads the compressed keys once per
row, and writes every column of an fp32 [rows, capacity] logits buffer (128 MB per layer at 4096 rows), although
`top_k_per_row_decode` reads row r only up to its visible count (position / 4).

`kernels/r9k_qsa_score.hip` (independent implementation from the stock kernel's documented semantics, same WMMA
pipeline as r9k_attn): one workgroup = 16 query rows x one column part; K[64 x 128] staged once per tile through
the page table, per head S^T = K . Q_h^T on 8 WMMA 16x16x16 bf16, relu, sum over heads, scale; the tile stops at
its last visible column and leaves the rest of the logits row untouched. Few-row batches (decode, MTP verify)
split the column range across workgroups (R9K_QSA_SCORE_SPLITS). `attn/qsa_score.py` mirrors the stock
`qsa_select_paged_tokens` (same 128 MB chunking, stock top-k and expansion) and is bound as `_select` on every
`QSAIndexer` instance from `qsa.install`; `R9K_QSA_SCORE=stock` keeps vLLM's kernel. The indexer runs inside
vLLM's `qwen4_exp_qsa_with_output` custom op, so the ctypes launch is outside torch.compile and cudagraph-safe.

`tests/test_qsa_score.py` (single GPU, 15 cases: prefill tiles, chunked prefill to 32k, mixed batches with
padding rows and forced splits, decode, MTP verify, tiny contexts, page sizes 4/16/64, 1/2/4/8 heads): logits on
every visible column vs an fp32 reference, ours 1.4-4.2e-7 relative vs stock 1.4e-7-1.1e-6; visible counts equal;
selected token lists identical except where the differing blocks tie with the k-th best reference score
(4041/4096 rows identical on the random 4k case, the rest ties). Timing, 4 heads, page 16, scorer alone / end to
end (score + top-k + expand):

| shape | stock | **ours** | stock e2e | **ours e2e** |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 4k chunk, ctx 12288 | 2,430 us | **752** | 2,547 | **1,049** |
| 4k chunk, ctx 32768 | 6,561 | **2,029** | 7,253 | **2,511** |
| 2k prefill | 210 | **65** | 273 | **184** |
| decode 1 row, ctx 8000 | 79 | **38** | 214 | **180** |
| MTP 16 reqs x 4 rows | 82 | **57** | 219 | **179** |

Expected serving effect: ~-65 ms per 4k chunk at 12k context (~9% of GPU-busy), more at 32k. Serving A/B by probe,
same day, TP=4 (`~/tp4tune/{qsc-r9k,qsc-stock}`): decode 148.5 -> 149.6 tok/s, c8 556 -> 533 (probe spread on c8
across earlier identical configs is 517-562), c16 768 -> 770, **prefill 8k 5,549 -> 6,188 tok/s (+11.5%)**. Full
20-pass BetterBench of the new default (`~/tp4tune/bb-final5`; same box, checkpoint and settings as bb-final4):

| | bb-final4 (stock scorer) | **bb-final5 (r9k scorer)** | Rob's image |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| decode score | 125.0 | 123.2 | 134.1 |
| step p50 | 21.15 ms | 21.27 ms | 20.44 ms |
| TTFT p50 | 104 ms | 103 ms | 145 ms |
| prefill 2k / 8k / 16k / 32k | 5,106 / 5,624 / 5,726 / 5,532 | **5,607 / 6,281 / 6,406 / 6,158** | 5,279 / 5,711 / 5,977 / 6,106 |
| concurrency 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 | 118 / 197 / 292 / 433 / 543 | 117 / 193 / 311 / 437 / 561 | 126 / 197 / 303 / 427 / 542 |

Prefill +10-12% at every length and now ahead of Rob's image at all four (+6 / +10 / +7 / +1%); concurrency at
parity or better (the probe's c8 dip was noise); decode -1.4%, inside the spread of identical earlier runs
(123.1-125.1). Remaining gap to Rob: single-stream decode (his MTP-4) and step p50. Numerics: scores differ from stock only in fp32 summation order, so
selections differ only at exact ties; no paired eval needed. Commit fd950d4 (local).

### 2026-09-28 (cont.): re-profiled, the TP=4 down GEMM, and the PLE transposes

4k-chunk profile with the r9k scorer (`~/tprof-ours-prefill4kb`): GPU-busy 731 -> 653 ms (Rob 625); QSA 96 -> 19 ms
(Rob 46). Remaining per family: elementwise 160 vs 97, MoE 176 vs 141, dense GEMM 125 vs 118, all-reduce 148 vs 200,
GDN 14.5 vs 20. Per kernel:

- **Down GEMM at TP=4 ran on the decode kernel.** Per rank K=160; `r9k_moe_4bit_prefill` and `pick_moe_prefill`
  required K % 64 although the BK=32 tiles (cfgs 8-11) walk K as whole 32-slabs. 49 calls x 1.5 ms = 73 ms per
  chunk. Guard is now per tile (`r9k_moe_prefill_bk`), plus a 64x128 BK=32 tile (cfg 17). Bench (E=512, top-10,
  4096 tokens, `tuning/prefill_moe_bench.py --tp 4`): down 1,946 us (old) -> 1,222 (cfg 11) / 1,250 (cfg 17);
  folded variants slower (1,328 / 1,429); cfg 11 stays the default. Still only 27 TFLOPs: the epilogue writes 2-byte
  scattered elements (a wave's store covers two 32 B row fragments) and the down output is 210 MB per chunk --
  ablation queued (`-DR9K_PF_ABL=8`, no epilogue stores) to size an LDS-staged epilogue.
- **`torch.zeros` of the down buffer** (168 MB, 260 us x 49 = 10.6 ms per chunk) dropped when there is no expert
  map: the hot and cold passes write every routed row (`R9K_MOE_ZERO_DOWN=1` restores it).
- **PLE short conv: 27.5 ms per chunk, of which 23.4 ms are six ATen strided copies** -- the two
  `transpose(1, 2).contiguous()` around `F.conv1d` on [prefills, 4096, 10240] bf16 at ~14 GB/s (5.9 ms each; the
  depthwise conv itself is 1.1 ms). `kernels/r9k_transpose.hip` (64x64 LDS tiles, 16 B coalesced both ways) +
  `ple/short_conv.py`: the stock prefill method with the two transposes on our kernel, bound per PLE layer
  (`R9K_PLE_CONV=stock` keeps vLLM's). Test vs the stock method (bit-identical output and conv state) pending.
- Also seen: `hc_combine_norm` 575 us x 97 (Rob ~420), `hc_gate_mix` 322 us x 100 (Rob ~270) -- stock Triton, one
  program per row, 512-wide blocks; a HIP rewrite is the next elementwise item. `aten::mul` in the compiled MoE
  graph 2.8 ms; `w8a8_triton_block_scaled_mm` 34 ms (Rob's fp8 GEMM 29).

Serving probe (TP=4) after the down tile + no zero fill: decode 149.6 -> 148.8, c8 533 -> 550, c16 770 -> 783,
**prefill 8k 6,188 -> 6,639 tok/s** (+7.3%; +20% over the stock-scorer 5,549 of the same morning). Commit 115ae91.

**Prefill epilogue root cause (ablations, cfg 11 down GEMM, TP=4, 4096 tokens):** 1,191 us as is; 976 with the
stores skipped; **447 with no epilogue at all**. The epilogue gathered `As[row]` and `topk_w[row]` per output
element, re-read for every column tile: ~45% of the K=160 kernel. Both prefill kernels now build a per-row scale
table in LDS next to `sRow` once per routing block. Single-buffered BK=32 tiles (cfgs 18/19, half the LDS) had
been tried first and changed nothing, which ruled out occupancy. With the fix, folded weights, 4096 tokens:

| routed GEMM | MT kernel | cfg 11 / 15 (old defaults) | **cfg 17 (64x128 BK=32)** |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| TP=4 down 2560x160 | 1,982 us | 855 | **811** |
| TP=4 gate_up 320x2560 | 969 | 980 | **899** |
| TP=2 down 2560x320 | 2,719 | 1,270 | **1,169** |
| TP=2 gate_up 640x2560 | 2,085 | 1,638 | **1,531** |

cfg 17 is the default for both GEMMs (`R9K_MOE_PREFILL_CFG` / `_CFG1` still override). Remaining epilogue cost is
the 2-byte scattered C stores (~200-350 us of the 811); staging the C tile through LDS for 16 B row stores is the
next step there. `tests/test_prefill_4bit.py`, `test_atiled_4bit.py`, `test_cache_moe.py` pass.

**PLE short conv:** `r9k_transpose16` 3,121 -> 444 us on the [1, 4096, 10240] transpose; the prefill method
26.5 -> 4.1 ms per call, output and conv state bit-identical to stock on one long prefill, a mixed batch with a
decode prefix, tiny lengths, NULL-block and empty-state cases (`tests/test_ple_conv.py`).

**Hyper-connection kernels (`kernels/r9k_hc.hip`, `hc.py`):** one 128-thread workgroup per (row, stream) for
combine_norm (combine result held as packed bf16 between the two passes; the first cut, one wave per stream with
fp32 registers, was register-bound at 558 us and, worse, 12.5 us vs stock's 3.7 in graph replay at decode widths --
it cost 0.8 ms/step in the first serving probe), one wave per (row, 256 columns) for gate_mix. Graph-timed, 4096
rows: combine_norm 607 -> 469 us, gate_mix 318 -> 310; at 1-64 rows stock is at the launch floor (3.4 us) and ours
0.5-2 us behind, so rows below `R9K_HC_MIN_ROWS` (256; gate_mix 1024) stay on stock -- decode never sees ours.
Combine output bit-identical to stock, norm output at stock's own bf16 error (`tests/test_hc_r9k.py`). Installed by
binding over `hyperconnection.py`'s imported names as torch.ops.r9700 custom ops before tracing (they sit inside the
compiled graph; the op signatures need full type annotations or the engine refuses to start).

**Round-2 serving result (2026-09-28, TP=4).** Probe after all of the above: decode 150.1, c8 521, c16 794,
prefill 8k 7,287 tok/s (5,549 with the stock scorer this morning: +31%). Full 20-pass BetterBench, same box,
checkpoint and settings (`~/tp4tune/bb-final6`):

| | bb-final4 (stock QSA scorer) | bb-final5 (r9k scorer) | **bb-final6 (round 2)** | Rob's image |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| decode score | 125.0 | 123.2 | **125.4** | 134.1 |

| concurrency 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 | 118 / 197 / 292 / 433 / 543 | 117 / 193 / 311 / 437 / 561 | 118 / 193 / 308 / 442 / 550 | 126 / 197 / 303 / 427 / 542 |

Prefill +19 / +30 / +26 / +19% over Rob's image at 2k / 8k / 16k / 32k (+24-31% over this morning's default);
concurrency at parity; single-stream decode unchanged (-6.5% vs his MTP-4). Sanity check below.

**Staged C stores in the prefill epilogues.** The WMMA D layout leaves each lane 8 rows of one column, so the
direct store was 2 bytes per lane. Each wave now writes its TM*16 x 16-column strip into LDS (the slab buffers,
free after the K loop) and stores whole 16 B row chunks. Whole-wave-tile staging (JS = TN) needs more LDS than the
slabs on cfg 17 and measured worse (down 745 us) than one strip at a time (690), so `PF_STAGE_MAX` = 16 KB keeps
cfg 17 at one strip. TP=4 folded 4096 tokens: down 811 -> 690 us (1,932 on the decode kernel this morning), gate_up
899 -> 883; TP=2: down 1,169 -> 1,077, gate_up 1,531 -> 1,510. A first cut put the stage past the slabs but left
the row tables at the slab end, so cfg 17's stage overwrote them (memory fault): the tables now sit past
max(slabs, stage). Probe: decode 150.6, c8 522, c16 794, prefill 8k 7,346 tok/s.

**Re-profile after round 2 (`~/tprof-ours-prefill4kc`, 4189-token prompt, TP=4):** GPU-busy **548 ms vs Rob's
625** (731 this morning), span 602 vs 666; 8,051 kernel launches vs his 5,393.

| family | ours | Rob | biggest items |
|---|--:|--:|---|
| all-reduce | 146.6 | 200.0 | ar4_pack_push 58.2 x202, push2 27.1, reduce_pack_push 26.6, decode 8.3 x404 |
| dense GEMM | 127.1 | 117.9 | `_w8a8_triton_block_scaled_mm` 34.1 x196 vs his fp8hip 28.7; hipBLASLt bf16 equal in total |
| MoE | 118.3 | 141.1 | cfg 17 gate_up 34.8 + down 28.2 vs his m64 pair 101.7; moe_sum 21.4 vs 23.7 |
| elementwise | 112.5 | 97.0 | hc_combine_norm 41.2 vs 41.4 (equal now), hc_gate_mix 32.7 vs 26.9, misc glue +9 |
| QSA | 18.6 | 46.2 | |
| GDN | 14.4 | 20.3 | |

Kernel-side gaps are single digits now. The largest remaining item on eager 4k chunks is the 54 ms of launch gaps
(span - busy; Rob 41 ms), i.e. the CPU floor: cudagraph capture of prefill chunks above 2048 tokens was rejected
on 2026-09-25 for padding cost, when a chunk's GPU time was 25% higher than now -- re-measured and **rejected
again** (`~/chain-cg4k.out`, same day, TTFT ms): 2166 tokens 293 -> 323, 3086 394 -> 435 (padding to the next
capture size), 6076 798 -> 797, 12.7k 1731 -> 1726, 25k 3514 -> 3505 (no gain: the eager 4k chunk is not
CPU-bound in practice), KV capacity 258,389 -> 176,128 tokens. Capture sizes stay dense to 2048.

Current TTFT sweep (tokens: ms / tok/s): 236: 86 / 2,736; 695: 134 / 5,184; 1,325: 228 / 5,800; 2,166: 293 / 7,391;
3,086: 394 / 7,825; 6,076: 798 / 7,612; 12,746: 1,731 / 7,365; 25,367: 3,514 / 7,219 (2026-09-25: 287 / 284 / 259 /
564 / 564 / 1,075 / 2,248 / 4,509 ms).

Remaining elementwise glue after the hc kernels (38.6 ms vs Rob's ~29): `r9k_silu_mul_quant_fp8` 6.4 ms x102,
`__amd_rocclr_copyBuffer` 5.0 ms x244, stock `per_token_group_quant_8bit` 4.2 x196 (input quant of the block-fp8
GEMM), `r9k_quant_rows_fp8` 5.4, `aten::mul` in the compiled MoE graph 2.9 -- nothing above 1% of the chunk.

### 2026-09-28 round 3: decode -- where the 21 ms/step goes

Target: decode 125.4 vs Rob's 134.1 (step 21.06 vs 20.44 ms, MTP-3 vs his MTP-4). Decode profiles at MTP-3, MTP-4 and
of Rob's image (`~/tprof-{ours-decode3,ours-decode4,rob-decode}`, 256-token generation, rank 0; per-step scripts
`~/dec-step.py`, `~/dec-gaps.py`, `~/dec-eager.py`, `~/dec-tail.py` on VM100):

| per step | ours MTP-3 | ours MTP-4 | Rob MTP-4 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| kernel nodes | 3,254 | 3,363 | 1,639 |
| GPU busy (ms) | 15.8 | 17.1 | 18.1 |
| unprofiled step (ms) | 21.06 | 22.5 | 20.8 |

**Our GPU time per step is lower than Rob's; the deficit is the node count.** The target forward is one HIP graph
(2,823 nodes); the gaps sit inside its replay, not at eager launches (97% of kernels come from `hipGraphLaunch`,
the CPU runs ~30 ms ahead). Rob's gaps are a uniform ~5.6 us per node under the profiler; ours bunch after runs
of tiny ATen nodes. A microbench of graph replay on this ROCm (`~/graphnode-bench.py`) puts a tiny dependent node
at 2.85 us (eager launch 8.7), and unprofiled arithmetic gives ~1.6 us of non-busy time per node for both stacks
(ours 5.2 ms over 3,254, Rob 2.4 over 1,639). `hipGraphLaunch` of the 2,823-node graph also costs the CPU ~6 us
per node under the profiler (16.8 ms per call), so bursts of small nodes starve the GPU. Either way: fewer, fatter
nodes. Where our extra ~1,600 nodes per step come from (48 layers + 3 MTP passes):

- QSA indexer glue (~30 per QSA layer, 15 passes): GemmaRMSNorm takes ir.ops.rms_norm's native path (fp32
  `1 + w` weight, ~10 ATen launches per norm, two norms), and the 1-D neox rope runs `ApplyRotaryEmb.forward_static`
  (~9 launches; flash_attn's Triton rotary is not in the image). ~400 nodes.
- Hyper-connection per block: two wvSplitK skinny GEMMs (the merged 336x10240 down+inject at 14.4 us, the 10240x320
  up at 12.2 us: 6.5 MB each at ~500 GB/s) plus Triton `hc_silu`, `hc_gate_mix`, `hc_combine_norm`. Rob runs one
  `hc_fused_kernel` (38 us). ~200 excess nodes, and ~26 us of GEMM per block that a streaming kernel could halve.
- Shared expert as a separate dense path: two mxfp4 GEMMs on the default (2,4,2) config = 5 workgroups for the
  320-wide gate_up (18 us for 0.4 MB), two row quants, Triton silu-mul, a 6 us wvSplitK for the [1 x 2560] expert
  gate, sigmoid, mul. ~250 nodes.
- GDN layer glue (conv update, cat, index copies, elementwise) ~10 per layer; MoE align/count/topk 3 per layer;
  10 NCCL all-gathers per step (the MTP head's `fc_embedding` / `fc_hidden` are built with `gather_output=True`,
  2 per draft at ~47 us, plus the logits all-gather per head: 79 us drafts, 199 us target). Rob pays 5 x 170 us
  through libr4d.
- GPU-time items on top: the router gate is a plain bf16 `ReplicatedLinear` -> hipBLASLt picks a 16x16x32 tile
  (19.6 us x 51 for 2.6 MB); the TP=4 block-fp8 and dense shapes were all untuned (`tuned.json` only had TP=2 and
  27B shapes); block-fp8 projections run at ~480 GB/s whatever the config (kernel-bound, 22 + 10 us per layer).

**Done, in order, each measured with the 1-minute probe (`~/tp4tune.sh`, TP=4, MTP-3):**

1. `tuned.json` for the TP=4 shapes (`tuning/tune_dense.py` SHAPES extended): mxfp4 320x2560 11.2 -> 6.7 us,
   2560x160 6.9 -> 5.6, LM head 62080x2560 156 -> 143; fp8block 4096x2560 23.0 -> 21.9, 2560x1536 9.5 -> 8.3,
   3584x2560 20.9 -> 19.7 (M=4, graph-timed).
2. **Router GEMM** (`kernels/r9k_router.hip`, `r9700_vllm/router.py`): bf16 x bf16 -> fp32 accumulate, one wave per
   (expert, K split), rounded once to bf16 as hipBLASLt's bf16 output is (differs only in summation order;
   `tests/test_router_r9k.py`: top-10 agreement 1.0, flips only on near-ties). Bound as the forward of every
   `mlp.gate` (48 + MTP). 5.4 us at 4 rows vs 7.5 warm / 19.6 served; above 8 rows it loses to hipBLASLt (re-reads
   the activations per expert), so the op switches to `torch.mm(out_dtype=fp32)` + cast at run time. Split 4/8 at
   4 rows is anomalously slow (30 us) -- unexplained, split 2 is the default.
   Probe `rt-r9k` (1 + 2): step 21.37 -> 20.93 ms, decode 150.6 -> 154.9 tok/s, c8 522 -> 525, c16 794 -> 843,
   prefill 8k 7,346 -> 7,324.
3. **QSA indexer glue** (`kernels/r9k_norm_rope.hip`, `r9700_vllm/attn/indexer_glue.py`): one launch per
   (Gemma norm [+ rope]) per head set, fp32 math with the native path's rounding points, neox rope on bf16 cos/sin
   with the three bf16 roundings of `forward_static`, and the MRoPE section rule of `_triton_mrope_forward`
   (interleaved or concatenated, [3, T] positions) so both q (1-D or MRoPE positions) and k (MRoPE) are fused.
   Bound as `project_qk` / `normalize_compressed_keys` on every QSAIndexer (`R9K_QSA_GLUE=stock` reverts).
   `tests/test_indexer_glue_r9k.py`: bit-equal to the stock functions except fp32-order flips of the sum of squares.
   Graph-timed at 4 tokens: stock norm+rope 58.5 us -> 6.0; norm 34 -> 4.0. The first serving build still took
   stock's rope after our norm on 12 calls/step: `normalize_compressed_keys` gets its positions as `[:, 0]` of a
   `[T, 3]` buffer (1-D, element stride 3) and the fit check demanded unit stride. The kernel now takes a token
   stride for the positions (`ptok`; the MRoPE `[3, T]` transpose view with row stride 1 / token stride 3 is covered
   the same way), and the test has stride-3 / stride-5 / MRoPE stride-2 cases. Confirmed in serving: the round-3
   eval server logs no "not fused" warning, so both indexer paths are on the one-launch glue.
4. **Hyper-connection decode mix** (router kernel with an `hc_silu` epilogue on the merged down+inject GEMM, and
   `r9k_hc_up_mix` in `kernels/r9k_hc.hip`: up GEMM + sigmoid + gated mean over the four streams in one wave per
   four output dims, gate rounded to bf16 as the GEMM output was, streams summed in stock's order). Bound as
   `GatedResidual.mix` / `combine_and_mix` (`hc.install_mix`, `R9K_HC_MIX=stock` reverts); rows above 8 take
   stock's path inside the ops. `tests/test_hc_mix_r9k.py`. Cold microbench at 4 rows: stock down GEMM 17.6 us ->
   9.6 (split 8), up GEMM 9.4 -> up+mix 13.2 (weight rows read 64 B per lane-group; still slower than wvSplitK's
   up GEMM alone but it absorbs sigmoid + mean); the whole mix 48 -> 25.5 us.

**Probe with all three (`mix-r9k`, vs `rt-r9k` / this morning's `epi-r9k`):** step 19.64 ms (20.93 / 21.37),
decode 163.4 tok/s (154.9 / 150.6), c8 559 (525 / 522), c16 868 (843 / 794), prefill 8k 7,387 (flat). -8.1% step
time in the round. Rob's probe on this box: 169 / 503 / 769 / 6,446. Paired 800-question chain-of-thought eval
(round-2 default vs round 3) and the full BetterBench (`bb-final7`) ran after the hardware move (2026-09-29):

**bb-final7 (round 3, TP=4, MTP-3):** decode 139.1 tok/s, step p50 19.01 ms, TTFT p50 88 ms, prefill
6444 / 7514 / 7630 / 7349 at 2k / 8k / 16k / 32k, concurrency 131 / 216 / 324 / 457 / 598 at c1..c16, sanity 8/8.
Against bb-final6 (round 2): decode +11%, step -10%, prefill +2..+3%, c8 +3%, c16 +9%; single-stream decode is
ahead of Rob's image (134.1) for the first time.

**Paired eval: round 3 is WORSE.** 800 chain-of-thought questions at conc 1: qt-r2 (round-2 default) 98.00% vs
qt-r3 96.88%; discordant 10 (r2-only right) vs 1 (r3-only right), McNemar p = 0.012; identical output on 31.5%.
One of the three round-3 defaults perturbs the answers -- the router GEMM is the suspect (its near-tie flips change
expert selection; the glue and hc mix differ from stock only in fp32 summation order). Bisect queued
(`~/chain-bisect.sh`): router off / router alone / everything on (with round 4), each paired against qt-r2. Round 3
must not stay the default until the culprit is found or reverted (the knobs: `R9K_ROUTER=stock`,
`R9K_QSA_GLUE=stock`, `R9K_HC_MIX=stock`).

**Bisect (2026-09-29, `~/evalcmp.py` over every saved run):** router off (`qt-r3a`) 97.38%, router alone (`qt-r3b`)
97.38%, each 6 / 1 against qt-r2 (p = 0.125). But qt-r2's 98.00% is the outlier: the four earlier runs of the same
default (qt-ref / qt-new / qt-def030 / qt-ar4) sit at 97.50-97.62% and qt-r2 beats them 4 / 0, 4 / 1, 3 / 0 -- it
got four questions right that the default usually misses. Against those runs, r3a and r3b are 4 / 2 and 5 / 3, the
same as the runs against each other (5 / 4, 4 / 4): noise. Only the full round 3 (qt-r3, 96.88%) still leans worse
against the older runs (6 / 0, 7 / 1, 7 / 2), and one question (3195b2b45ffb) is wrong in all three round-3 legs and
in none of the five earlier runs. The one round-3 change no leg switched off is the TP=4 `tuned.json` entries
(1554e9a: block-fp8 dense shapes and the LM head take different split-K configs, so their fp32 sums round
differently). Queued: a replicate of round 3 (`qt-r3c`) and the round-2 config again (`qt-r2b`, the noise floor).
If qt-r3c repeats ~96.9% the tuned entries get their own leg; if it lands at 97.5% the round-3 verdict was noise.

Remaining node budget (eager profile with Python stacks, `~/dec-stack.py`, ~2,770 kernels/step after the round):
GDN spec-decode glue in `qwen_gdn_linear_attn.py` (cat / reshape / contiguous / zeros / copies, ~9 per layer x 36:
vLLM fuses only the non-speculative decode path), the shared expert's own quant + silu + expert-gate GEMM + sigmoid
+ mul (~5 per layer), `moe_align_block_size` + `count_and_sort` + `topk_softmax` + `moe_sum` + the top-k weight copy
(5 per layer, stock), the block-fp8 input quant (2 per layer), 10 NCCL all-gathers.

### 2026-09-28 round 4: GDN speculative-decode core in one launch

The largest remaining block of decode glue was the Gated DeltaNet layers (36 of 48). Stock vLLM has a fused CUDA op
for exactly the MTP decode step (`fused_gdn_decode_post_conv_mtp`: gating + recurrence + gated norm after the conv
update), but it is not built in the ROCm image, so `forward_cuda` runs the Triton recurrence inside glue: `b` / `a`
made contiguous, a zeroed core buffer, the q/k/v `cat`, the conv update, `fused_sigmoid_gating_delta_rule_update`,
the output copy, `layer_norm_fwd`, and three reshape copies -- 11 HIP-graph nodes per layer, ~400 per step (the
eager stack profile: `reshape` x108, `contiguous` x72, `cat` x36, `zeros` x36, copyBuffer x36 from
`qwen_gdn_linear_attn.py`).

`kernels/r9k_gdn.hip` `r9k_gdn_decode_mtp` (`r9700_vllm/models/gdn.py`): one workgroup per (sequence, value head)
holds the 128x128 fp32 state in registers (64 per thread, K halves paired by shuffle), runs the sigmoid gating and
the delta-rule recurrence over the sequence's spec tokens (state stored per token at its slot, sequences with a
null initial slot skipped, padding rows zeroed), and applies RMSNormGated (RMS over V through LDS, silu gate) in the
same launch. It reads the merged in_proj row and `ba` directly (any row strides), so nothing is copied. The layer's
forward becomes in_proj -> `torch.ops.r9700.gdn_core` -> out_proj; inside the op a pure spec-decode batch takes the
conv update + the kernel (2 launches), anything else (prefill, mixed batches, warmup) takes stock's core + norm.
`R9K_GDN_DECODE=stock` restores vLLM's forward. `tests/test_gdn_decode_r9k.py` checks it against vLLM's Triton
composition: output flips ~2e-4 of the elements (fp32 summation order), fp32 state within 1e-4, bf16 state by the
same flip rule, padding and skipped sequences zero.

**Shared expert in four launches** (`r9700_vllm/moe/shared.py`, `torch.ops.r9700.shared_expert`): the MoE block's
shared expert (a gated `Qwen3NextMLP`, 48 + MTP calls per step) ran as our dense MXFP4 gate_up (row quant + GEMM),
`SiluAndMul`, down (quant + GEMM), then the expert gate's bf16 `F.linear` (wvSplitK), `sigmoid` and `mul`: eight
launches. Now the row quant also computes the gate dot and its sigmoid (`r9k_quant_rows_fp8_gate`, stock's rounding
points: bf16 logit, bf16 sigmoid -- bit-equal to stock's gate on every tested row), the activation is the routed
MoE's `silu_mul_quant_fp8`, and the sigmoid is folded into the down GEMM's per-row epilogue (the router-weight
fold), so the output is rounded once. Large M takes the same prefill / A-tiled GEMM configs as the dense linear.
`tests/test_shared_expert_r9k.py`: TP=4 and TP=2 shapes at M = 1..1024, ours at least as close to the fp64
reference as stock (equal or better on 13 of 14 cases, within 0.7% on the other), 0.3-0.9% from stock in relative
norm (the activation's fp8 codes). `R9K_SHARED_EXPERT=stock` restores vLLM's forward.

**Unit timing (graph replay, idle GPU, `~/gates-gdn.out`), per layer call:**

| | stock | ours |
|---|---|---|
| GDN core, 1 sequence x 4 tokens (fp32 state) | 43.3 us (9 nodes) | 13.8 us (1) |
| GDN core, 4 sequences | 52.7 | 19.5 |
| GDN core, 16 sequences (fp32 / bf16 state) | 79.0 / 80.0 | 51.9 / 53.9 |
| shared expert, M = 1 / 4 / 16 | 44.1 / 46.1 / 46.7 (8 launches) | 18.3 / 18.5 / 18.9 (4) |

At batch 1 that is ~1.1 ms/step over the 36 GDN layers and ~1.2 ms over the 48 shared experts, against a 19.0 ms
step. At 16 sequences the GDN kernel is state-bandwidth bound (4 x 64 KB of state stores per head per layer, as
stock's); a split-V variant would help there if the concurrency numbers ask for it.

**Serving (first attempt: GPU memory fault on the first request).** Eager mode was fine and switching the fused
kernel off did not help, so the kernel was not the cause: vLLM lists its own `vllm::qwen_gdn_attention_core` in
`CompilationConfig._attention_ops`, the default piecewise-graph splitting list, so the GDN core runs eagerly at
every step of a piecewise prefill graph (its Triton kernels take that step's sequence layout). Our op replaced it
in the traced forward without that entry, so a prefill piece captured our op's kernels for the capture batch and
replayed them for every later one. `register_splitting_op()` now appends `r9700::gdn_core` to that class list at
plugin load (the install log reports whether the engine's `splitting_ops` has it). Rule for future plugin ops:
anything that replaces a splitting op must be added to that list. (Also caught on the way: Flash-Next's output
gate is `sigmoid`, and the first fit check only took silu, so the core silently sat out of one serving run; the
check now logs its reason.)

**Probe, GDN core only (`gdn-live`, shared expert stock) vs the round-3 default on the same build (`r4-stock`):**
decode 166.5 -> 170.3 tok/s (+2.3%, 3.09 -> 3.12 tok/step), c8 573 -> 561, c16 852 -> 865, prefill 8k 7407 ->
7171 (the last three within the probe's run-to-run band). Smaller than the ~1.1 ms/step the unit timing
suggested: in a captured decode graph the removed nodes were cheaper than in the eager profile.

**Probe, both fusions (`se-r9k`):** decode 190.9 tok/s (3.2 tok/step), step 17.16 ms, c8 623, c16 891, prefill 8k
7,233 -- vs `r4-stock` 166.5 / 19.3 / 573 / 852 / 7,407. The shared expert's four launches are worth more than the
GDN core's one: 48 calls per step against 36, and the router-weight fold removes the expert-gate GEMM outright.

**bb-final8 (round 4 = round 3 + GDN core + shared expert; TP=4, MTP-3, 20 passes):** decode **159.2 tok/s**, step
p50 **16.79 ms**, TTFT p50 94 ms, prefill 6,408 / 7,365 / 7,451 / 7,182, concurrency 151 / 231 / 350 / 478 / 635,
sanity 8/8. Against bb-final7: decode +14%, step -12%, concurrency +5..+15%, prefill -0.5..-2.4% (within the
run-to-run band; the GDN op now runs eagerly in the prefill pieces exactly as stock's did). Against Rob's image:
decode +19%, step -18%, TTFT 1.5x, prefill +18..+29%, concurrency +12..+20%.

**Quality, round 4 (`qt-r4c`, everything on, GDN core engaged):** 97.50% (780/800); paired against qt-r2 5 / 1,
McNemar p = 0.219, no detectable difference. Sanity 8/8.

**The round-3 question, closed (2026-09-29):** the round-2 configuration reruns at 97.88% one question apart
from its first run (qt-r2b vs qt-r2: 1 / 0, 87% identical outputs), so that build is near-deterministic, and the
round-3 family is consistently below it: 96.88 / 97.25 (round 3 twice), 97.38 / 97.38 (router off / router only),
97.00 with the round-2 tuning table (`qt-r3t`, 8 / 0, p = 0.008 -- so the TP=4 tuned entries are not the cause;
`test_tuned_cfgs` also passes on them), 97.50 with round 4 on top, 97.88 with the shared expert but the GDN core
off. Per component the drop is at the edge of detection (6 / 1, p = 0.125 each); combined it is real (8-10 / 1).
Read: the three round-3 decode fusions each perturb the numerics a little (fp32 order in the glue and mix, near-tie
routing flips in the router) and together cost ~0.5 point on this eval, which is inside the band the older builds
spanned (97.5-97.6) but below the round-2 build's 97.9-98.0. It is a knob, not a bug: `R9K_ROUTER=stock
R9K_QSA_GLUE=stock R9K_HC_MIX=stock` restores round-2 numerics at ~10% of decode. Shipped as-is for v0.2.0 with the
trade stated; the cleaner fix is per-fusion evals against a bit-reproducible baseline, one at a time.

*Superseded the same evening: on the full 1,319 questions no fusion, alone or together, costs anything (97.04% for
the default against 96.82% for the round-2 numerics, 5 / 8). The half point was the first-800 slice. See "the decode
fusions one at a time" below.*

### 2026-09-29: Flash-Next at TP2 with offloaded experts, on the 4-card box

Brian asked for a two-card benchmark with the experts in host RAM (the v0.1.0 way to run Flash-Next). Three
launches to get a fair one:

1. **GPUs 0,1 with the current defaults: no KV memory at all.** The 2048-token prefill graphs take 3.4 GiB per
   card at TP2 (1.8 at TP4) on top of the 15.8 GB expert cache; `CGSIZES=` (vLLM's default sizes) restores it.
2. **GPUs 0,1 with default graph sizes: 44k tokens of KV, and the quick probe collapsed at concurrency** (c8 54,
   c16 49 tok/s below the 81 single-stream; prefill 8k 1,379). 240 expert slots gave 105k tokens of KV and the same
   collapse, so KV was not it.
3. **One card per PLX switch (GPUs 0,2) fixed it:** 106 / 94 / 99 / 2,241 (single / c8 / c16 / prefill 8k) at 240
   slots, 114 / 132 / 120 / 2,464 at 270. The offloaded experts stream from pinned host memory down each switch's
   single Gen3 x16 uplink; two cards on one switch halve each other's read bandwidth, which is invisible when
   everything sits in VRAM (the TP4 numbers) and dominant when it does not. Also 154k tokens of KV on the split pair
   against 105k on the same-switch one at equal settings (the pair's P2P scratch differs).

**bb-qfn-tp2-offload (GPUs 0,2, OFFLOAD_GB=34/rank, 270 slots, CGSIZES default, otherwise v0.2.0 defaults; full
BetterBench 20 passes):** decode 93.8 tok/s, step p50 25.68 ms, TTFT p50 555 ms, prefill 2,099 / 3,163 / 3,434 /
3,329, concurrency 84 / 104 / 108 / 111 / 95, KV 71,859 tokens, sanity 8/8.

**The "concurrency loss" against 2026-09-20 was the harness, not the build.** The first write-up of this section
compared today's quick probe (c8 132) with the September-20 figure (conc-8 206) and called the difference an open
regression. The two were never the same measurement: 206 came from `bench/harness.py` (eight copies of ONE prompt,
a nonce apart, on the launcher's `NSEQ=4`), 132 from `~/probe.py` (two each of four different prompt types, code /
prose / json / math, at `NSEQ=16`). Four launches on GPUs 0,2, both harnesses against each server (`~/chain-hx.sh`,
`~/tp4tune/hx-*`):

| leg | step ms | probe single | probe c8 (mixed) | harness single | harness agg8 (one prompt) | harness prefill 2000w | KV tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.2.0 defaults, NSEQ=16 | 26.31 | 114.1 | 117.5 | 104.4 | 226.5 | 2,756 | 71,859 |
| v0.2.0 defaults, NSEQ=4 | 26.04 | 111.1 | 110.4 | 105.5 | 210.9 | 2,755 | 117,274 |
| September-20 knobs, NSEQ=4 | 32.61 | 92.2 | 93.6 | 86.1 | 207.2 | 2,164 | 124,625 |
| September-20 knobs, NSEQ=16 | 32.72 | 93.2 | 110.7 | 83.7 | 201.8 | 2,257 | 57,478 |
| 2026-09-20, as recorded | | | | 84.5 | 206 | 2,165 | |

("September-20 knobs" = prefix caching on, stock block-fp8, fp8 LM heads, stock QSA / scorer / qk-rope, and the
five decode fusions at stock, on today's build and image.) The old knobs reproduce the old numbers to within 2%,
so neither the move to four cards nor vLLM 0.30 changed this configuration. On the same harness v0.2.0 is +24%
single-stream, +27% prefill and -20% step time. The mixed probe reads c8 94-118 on every leg, old knobs included;
this morning's 132 was the top of that band.

**Why the mixed batch is slow: prompt diversity, not any one prompt** (`bench/mix.py`, conc 8, 256 tokens, median of
3, wall ms per step includes the prefill):

| 8 concurrent requests | v0.2.0: tok/s | tok/step | ms/step | Sept-20 knobs: tok/s | tok/step | ms/step |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| code x8 | 275 | 3.48 | 94 | 249 | 3.42 | 109 |
| prose x8 | 218 | 2.26 | 83 | 253 | 2.23 | 70 |
| json x8 | 338 | 3.86 | 92 | 439 | 3.83 | 69 |
| math x8 | 263 | 3.58 | 108 | 279 | 3.40 | 97 |
| harness prompt x8 | 223 | 2.60 | 95 | 244 | 2.64 | 84 |
| mixed (2 each of code / prose / json / math) | 119 | 3.14 | 213 | 112 | 3.03 | 219 |

Every prompt type runs at 218-439 tok/s on its own; two each of four types run at 112-119, at ordinary acceptance,
because the step itself takes 2.3x longer. With the experts in host RAM a step costs what it has to fetch. (First
reading, written before the counters existed: "a mixed batch routes to more distinct experts than the 270 slots
hold". Measured below: it does not -- it routes to 85 -- but it misses three times as many of them.) It is also why the
BetterBench concurrency curve for this configuration is flat from 2 requests up (104 / 108 / 111 / 95): its corpus
is mixed.

Two cautions from the same table. Homogeneous conc-8 does not separate the two builds: the harness prompt read
226.5 vs 201.8 in one pair of launches and 223 vs 244 in the next, so +-10% is launch-to-launch. And json x8 is
lower on v0.2.0 (338 vs 439, tight ranges within each launch, same acceptance, 92 vs 69 ms per step) -- one launch
each, so not a finding yet, but it is the first thing to repeat when this configuration gets its own pass.

**What bounds a mixed batch, measured (2026-09-29, same day).** The reading above was half right. Opt-in counters in
the expert cache (`R9K_EXPERT_CACHE_STATS=1`: device-side totals per cached layer of steps, distinct routed experts,
inserts, experts read through from host, steps over the insert threshold; a reader thread logs them every
`R9K_EXPERT_CACHE_STATS_SEC`; `tests/test_cache_stats.py` checks them against a host recount) on three launches,
rank 0, decode windows of `bench/mix.py -v`:

| 8 submitted (4 run, see below) | forward passes /s | ms per forward | distinct experts per layer | inserted | read through | miss | steps over threshold | host -> VRAM per forward |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| code x8 | 20.8-21.6 | 46-48 | 66-71 | 2.1-2.2 | 0.8-1.1 | 4.4-4.6% | 1.7-2.4% | 175-193 MiB |
| mixed (code / prose / json / math) | 10.9-11.6 | 86-92 | 85-87 | 10.3-11.1 | 1.4-1.7 | 14.0-14.5% | 2.3-2.6% | 714-751 MiB |
| one request (code) | 28-33 | 30-36 | 26-31 | 1.9-2.1 | 0-0.5 | 7.4-8.6% | 0-1% | 114-154 MiB |

1. **It is not the insert threshold** (with four requests running; with eight it is -- see "The full BetterBench
   of that candidate regressed" below). The LRU manager inserts nothing on a step that routes to more than
   `R9K_LRU_THRESH` x slots = 135 distinct experts; that was the suspect, and a mixed decode step is over it 2-3% of
   the time. Nor does a batch route to more experts than there are slots (85 of 270).
2. **It is the miss rate times the link.** A mixed batch misses 14% of its routed experts at every step, a
   single-type batch 4.5%. Each miss is 1.245 MiB per rank, and the copy kernel already runs at the link rate:
   `tuning/lru_gather_bench.py`, host -> VRAM, 11.4-13.5 GB/s from 4 inserts up on every launch grid (PCIe 3 x16).
   714-751 MiB per forward pass is 66-69 ms of the 86-92; a single stream still pays ~13 ms of its 36.
3. **The miss rate is the checkpoint's routing, not the policy.** Flash-Next routes diffusely: the busiest expert of
   a layer carries 1-2% of the routing, and 90% of it needs 216-365 of the 512 experts. By the routing profile
   shipped with the checkpoint the best static set of S experts per layer misses 24.0 / 17.4 / **13.3** / 9.9 / 7.1 /
   4.8 / 2.5% of the mass at S = 200 / 240 / **270** / 300 / 330 / 360 / 400 -- a mixed batch behaves like the global
   distribution, one prompt type like a much narrower one that the LRU follows. Re-splitting the same 12,960 slots
   across layers by marginal mass (195-367 per layer) only moves 13.3% to 12.8%: not worth a knob.
4. **A wider copy grid is worth ~8% on the mixed batch and nothing elsewhere:** `R9K_LRU_GATHER=64,16` against the
   default 8,16 is 15% faster at 13 inserts (1,262 vs 1,492 us) and equal at 2; served, mixed 106.5 -> 115.2 and
   113.9 tok/s (two launches), code x8 and single-stream unchanged. Candidate default, not yet flipped.

**And a second, separate limit: only four requests run at once.** Engine iterations against per-request steps
(`vllm:iteration_tokens_total_count` vs `vllm:spec_decode_num_drafts_total`, `--max-num-seqs 16`):

| submitted | tok/s | ms per iteration | requests per iteration |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 x code | 100 / 166-181 / 265-285 / 257-275 | 35 / 38-42 / 47-50 / 50 | 0.99 / 1.9 / 3.8 / 3.7-3.9 |
| 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 mixed | 91 / 100 / 103 / 111 | 38 / 44 / 60 / 76 | 1.0 / 1.6 / 2.1 / 2.7 |
| 8 / 16 mixed | 111-116 / 113-119 | 94-95 / 100-103 | 3.4-3.5 / 3.6-3.8 |

With four short requests running the KV pool is 93.5% used (46.75% with two) and the others wait with reason
`capacity`: every request takes 18 blocks of a 77-block pool whatever its length (the per-request recurrent state),
and at TP2 with the experts cached the pool is what is left after 25.84 GiB of weights and 3.24 GiB of peak
activation: 0.87 GiB on these launches, 1.38 GiB (71,859 tokens, so six requests) on the BetterBench one. Prefix
caching on does not change it (same 4). So on this configuration concurrency above 4-6 buys nothing for any
workload, and for a mixed one concurrency buys little at all (91 -> 111 tok/s from 1 to 4 requests) because every
additional prompt type brings its own experts down the same link. That is the flat BetterBench curve (104 / 108 /
111 / 95 from 2 to 16), and it is a property of two cards on a PCIe 3 host, not a defect to fix in a kernel.

**The knobs, measured (2026-09-29 evening, `~/chain-knobs.sh`, `~/tp4tune/t2-*`).** Same harnesses on every leg;
every configuration after the first was launched twice and measured on the second launch (see 1.):

| leg | KV pool (tokens) | weights / peak act. / graphs (GiB) | single | code x8 | json x8 | mixed x8 | requests per iteration, code x8 | prefill 8k |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| defaults, NSEQ=16, first launch | 45,415 | 25.84 / 3.24 / 2.42 | 100.5 | 279 | 329 | 109 | 3.9 | 2,473 |
| the same, second launch | 71,859 | 25.41 / 3.16 / 2.26 | 101.2 | 283 | 347 | 118 | 3.9 | 2,439 |
| + copy grid 64,16 | 71,859 | 25.41 / 3.16 / 2.26 | 105.7 | 286 | 354 | 139 | 3.9 | 2,455 |
| + **NSEQ=8** | 120,724 | 25.41 / 2.23 / 1.53 | 102.4 | **401** | **535** | 130 | **7.6** | 2,393 |
| + NSEQ=8, NBT=2048 | 168,439 | 24.79 / 1.95 / 1.53 | 104.4 | 413 | 538 | 123 | 7.3 | 1,821 |
| + NSEQ=8, 240 slots | 202,931 | 23.84 / 2.23 / 1.53 | 96.4 | 327 | 470 | 93 | 7.6 | 2,221 |
| + NSEQ=8, UTIL=0.96 | 154,067 | 25.41 / 2.23 / 1.53 | 103.0 | 393 | 536 | 127 | 7.5 | 2,383 |

1. **The first launch of a configuration gets a smaller KV pool than every later one**: 45,415 against 71,859
   tokens (0.87 against 1.38 GiB), and the same on every other leg (94k -> 121k, 102k -> 168k, 155k -> 203k). The
   launch that compiles keeps 0.43 GiB more in "weights + non-torch" and a larger activation peak; the pool is sized
   from what is left. It is vLLM's accounting, not ours, and it is why the afternoon's fast legs (all first
   launches) saw four requests where the morning's BetterBench launch would have run six. Operationally: restart
   once after changing a knob. The launcher header says so.
2. **NSEQ=8 is the concurrency fix for one prompt type: +42% to +54% at conc-8** (283 -> 401, 347 -> 535), single
   stream unchanged. Graphs and activation for 16 sequences cost 1.66 GiB that went to requests which could not run;
   at 8 the pool holds all eight (7.6 per iteration against 3.9). `serve/flashnext.sh` now defaults `NSEQ=8`
   (`NSEQ=16` for TP4, as every TP4 number here was measured).
3. **The mixed batch does not move with any of it**: 118-139 tok/s on every leg that kept 270 slots, whatever runs
   at once. Its second-launch readings scatter more than the knobs differ (the same eight requests read 121-127 in
   the iteration harness on all four of those legs), so the copy grid's +17% in one harness and 0% in the other is
   one more reason to call it "up to +10%", which is what the kernel timing predicts. It costs nothing elsewhere and
   cannot change outputs (a copy; data checked in the bench, sanity 8/8), so `R9K_LRU_GATHER` now defaults to 64,16.
4. **240 slots: rejected.** 80k more tokens of KV, and -28% on the mixed batch, -18% / -12% on one prompt type, -6%
   single stream, -7% prefill: the misses cost more than the room buys, as the routing profile said (17.4 against
   13.3%).
5. **NBT=2048: rejected as a default.** 48k more tokens of KV for -24% prefill (2,393 -> 1,821) and nothing else. It
   is the knob for someone who needs the context more than the prompt speed.
6. **UTIL=0.96: ran clean, not adopted.** 33k more tokens and the same throughput, 8/8 sanity; but these legs never
   held a long context while eight requests ran, and the graph pool already sits outside the budget. It needs a
   soak at 32k before it can be a default.

**The full BetterBench of that candidate regressed, and the insert threshold was the cause after all.**
`bb-qfn-tp2-n8` (NSEQ=8, copy grid 64,16): single stream, step, TTFT and prefill equal to the morning's run, and
concurrency 84 / 104 / 115 / **77 / 76** against 84 / 104 / 108 / 111 / 95. Letting eight requests run removed the
queue (TTFT at 8 concurrent 7.1 s -> 1.1 s) and lowered the total. Counters under BetterBench's own concurrency
sweep (`~/lrubb.sh`, `~/statphase.py`, rank 0, bucketed by requests running):

| requests running | threshold 0.5 (135): distinct / inserted / read through / miss / steps over / ms per forward | threshold 0.99 (267): the same |
|---|---|---|
| 3-4 | 93 / 8.8 / 2.1 / 11.6% / 2.5% / 84 | 95 / 10.1 / 1.0 / 11.7% / 0.8% / 84 |
| 5-8 | **148** / 2.5 / **31.2** / 22.7% / **72%** / **207** | 152 / 20.8 / 3.3 / 15.8% / 3.0% / 144 |
| conc-4 / conc-8 aggregate | 112.8 / **75.1** | 114.4 / **109.2** |

Eight DIFFERENT requests route to ~150 distinct experts a layer. That is over 0.5 x 270 on 72% of steps, where the
manager inserts nothing and refreshes nothing, so the cache stops following the traffic and every step reads 31
experts a layer through from host: 2 GB and 207 ms per forward pass. Point 1 above ("it is not the insert
threshold") was true of what it measured -- four requests running, 85 distinct experts, 2-3% of steps over -- and
wrong as a general statement: the capacity limit had been hiding the threshold, and `bench/mix.py`'s mixed batch has
four distinct prompts where BetterBench has 29. Point 3 of the knob legs ("the mixed batch does not move") is
superseded for the same reason. `R9K_LRU_THRESH` now defaults to **0.99** (the cache tests pin 0.5, the value their
step sizes were written for).

**bb-qfn-tp2-rc2 = the v0.2.1 TP2-offload default** (NSEQ=8, copy grid 64,16, threshold 0.99; 270 slots, NBT 4096,
UTIL 0.94; GPUs 0,2; second launch, KV 120,724 tokens; full BetterBench, 20 passes), against the morning's run of
the v0.2.0 defaults:

| | v0.2.0 defaults (`bb-qfn-tp2-offload`) | v0.2.1 defaults (`bb-qfn-tp2-rc2`) | |
|---|---|---|---|
| single-stream decode | 93.8 tok/s | 97.4 | +4% |
| step p50 | 25.68 ms | 25.62 | = |
| TTFT p50 | 555 ms | 484 | -13% |
| prefill 2k / 8k / 16k / 32k | 2,099 / 3,163 / 3,434 / 3,329 | 2,208 / 3,558 / 3,839 / 3,793 | +5 / +12 / +12 / +14% |
| aggregate at 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 | 84 / 104 / 108 / 111 / 95 | 87 / 109 / 116 / 118 / 113 | +4 / +5 / +7 / +6 / +19% |
| per-request decode at 8 (median) | 20.6 tok/s | 17.1 | eight run instead of ~six |
| TTFT p50 at 8 / 16 concurrent | 7.1 s / 37.9 s | **0.95 s** / 27.3 s | |
| 8 requests, one prompt (code / json) | 283 / 347 | 434 / 577 | +53 / +66% |
| 8 requests, four prompt types | 118 | 166 | +40% |
| sanity | 8 / 8 | 8 / 8 | |

The prefill gain arrived with the threshold (the NSEQ=8 run without it had the morning's prefill to the percent);
which steps of a prefill it changes has not been isolated. Gates (`test_cache_moe`, `test_cache_stats`) pass on
the new defaults.

**What the cards are doing meanwhile** (amdgpu `gpu_busy_percent`, `mem_busy_percent`, hwmon power and clock at 1 Hz,
joined with the server's request counters; both cards of the pair, 225 W cap):

| phase | busy | memory busy | W per card | clock | W per card before the threshold fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 request | 100% | 32% | 206 | 3,379 MHz | 203 |
| 2 requests | 100% | 26% | 199 | 3,385 | 197 |
| 3-4 requests | 100% | 21% | 179 | 3,399 | 175 |
| 5-8 requests | 100% | 15-16% | 168-171 | 3,402 | 150-152 |
| prefill, long prompts | 100% | 27% | 219 | 2,984 | 218 |
| TP4, 1 request (for scale) | 99% | 28% | 192 | 3,397 | |

A kernel is always running, and the more different requests run the LESS the cards compute: 206 W with one request,
170 W with eight. The rest of the time goes to experts arriving over the link. Only prefill sits at the cap with the
clock pulled down. Two cards with offloaded experts are link-bound with compute to spare; beyond these defaults
only three things move a mixed load: more VRAM for slots, a faster link, or routing that prefers resident experts
-- the last changes outputs and would need the full paired eval before it could be offered even as an option.

Placement rule, now measured both ways: **same switch for tensor parallel, one card per switch for offload.**
The launcher header says so; `GPUS=0,2` on this box.

### 2026-09-29: the decode fusions one at a time, on the full test set (the round-3 question, answered)

Item 1 of the list below, run the same day (`~/chain-qf.sh` / `chain-qf2.sh` on VM100, `~/qfcmp.py`): Flash-Next
TP4, **all 1,319 GSM8K test questions**, chain-of-thought, concurrency 1. Reference = round-2 numerics on the
current build (all five decode fusions at stock); one fusion on per leg; then the shipped default; then the
reference again.

| leg | accuracy | reference-only right | leg-only right | McNemar p (exact) | identical outputs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| reference (`qf-base`) | 96.82% (1,277) | | | | |
| reference again (`qf-base2`) | 96.82% | 0 | 0 | 1.00 | 99.9% |
| router GEMM | 96.82% | 6 | 6 | 1.00 | 31.8% |
| indexer norm + rope glue | 96.97% | 0 | 2 | 0.50 | 87.2% |
| hyper-connection mix | 97.04% | 5 | 8 | 0.58 | 35.3% |
| GDN speculative-decode core | 96.97% | 5 | 7 | 0.77 | 31.9% |
| shared expert | 96.74% | 6 | 5 | 1.00 | 31.2% |
| **all five (the v0.2.0 default)** | **97.04%** | 5 | 8 | 0.58 | 29.9% |

1. **No fusion costs accuracy, alone or together.** The discordant pairs are balanced on every leg, and the shipped
   default is three questions ABOVE the round-2 numerics, which means nothing either.
2. **The reference is bit-reproducible** (1,318 of 1,319 outputs identical six hours apart, no discordant
   pair), so the noise floor of this comparison is zero and every discordant pair above is the fusion's doing: a
   fusion changes which marginal questions come out right, not how many.
3. **The "~0.5 point" of yesterday was the subset.** On the first 800 questions -- yesterday's eval -- the same
   eight runs read as they did then: reference 97.88% (1 / 0 against `qt-r2`), router 6 / 1, hc mix 6 / 2, GDN 5 / 2,
   shared expert 5 / 0, all five 97.50% and 5 / 1, exactly `qt-r4c`. The round-2 numerics score 98.0% on those 800
   and 95.0% on the other 519: they sit on the lucky side of the marginal questions of that slice, so anything that
   reshuffles marginal questions looks like a loss there and like a gain on the rest. Paired tests do not protect
   against that; a reference that scores unusually well on the slice is itself the outlier, which the bisect had
   already half seen ("qt-r2 is the lucky outlier") before settling on the wrong reading.
4. **Consequences.** The three `=stock` knobs buy nothing measurable and cost ~10% of decode; the quality
   statement of v0.2.0 (changelog, release notes, README) is corrected in v0.2.1; the eval for a change of default
   is from now on the full 1,319 questions (40 minutes at TP4), not the first 800.

### 2026-10-01: after v0.2.1 -- what the two-card prefill number means, and the UTIL soak

**Why prefill rose with the insert threshold: the benchmark's prompt, not prompts in general.** v0.2.1's BetterBench
prefill is 5-14% above v0.2.0's and the release said it had not been isolated. `bench/prefill_kinds.py` (new) sends
two kinds of prompt to the same server -- BetterBench's own filler, which is one paragraph's ~75 words shuffled, and
slices of real text (this repository's notes) -- with the cache counters on (TP2 + offload, GPUs 0,2, rank 0):

| prompt | threshold 0.5: tok/s | distinct / read through per layer | steps over | threshold 0.99: tok/s | distinct / read through | steps over |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BetterBench filler, 8k | 3,342 | 312 / 125 | 100% | 3,672 (+10%) | 241 / 70 | 59% |
| BetterBench filler, 24k | 3,218 | 268 / 112 | 86% | 3,645 (+13%) | 269 / 76 | 63% |
| real text, 6.6k-8.4k | 2,467 | 247 / 99 | 55% | 2,288 (2,123-2,683) | 307 / 129 | 70% |
| real text, 20k-26k | 2,568 | 339 / 145 | 76% | 2,526 | 367 / 160 | 83% |

A 4,096-token chunk of the filler routes to 240-310 distinct experts a layer, which straddles 0.99 x 270 = 267: about
40% of its steps now insert, the cache learns the filler's experts, and a third fewer are read through. A chunk of
real text routes to 310-370 and stays over either threshold; its prefill does not move (the 8k pair differs by its
own scatter). So: **on two cards with offloaded experts real documents prefill at about 2,300-2,600 tok/s, some 30%
below the BetterBench figure, on v0.2.0 and v0.2.1 alike**, and the release's "+5..+14% prefill" is a statement about
narrow prompts. The four-card numbers do not have this dependence (nothing is fetched). README corrected.

**The soak found a memory leak in the released two-card default, not a UTIL question** (`bench/soak.py`, new: 8
clients for 15 minutes, each sending an 18k-30k-token slice of real text and asking for 256 tokens; VRAM from
`mem_info_vram_used` at 1 Hz). Flash-Next TP2 + offload, v0.2.1 defaults (UTIL 0.94, NSEQ 8, KV 120,724 tokens):

| | v0.2.1 as released | with the fix |
|---|---|---|
| requests served / failed | 77 / **369** | 111 / 0 |
| VRAM used per card | 30.5 -> 32.6 GiB in 13 minutes (the whole card), then `torch.OutOfMemoryError`, engine dead | 30.98 GiB flat for 15 minutes, one step to 31.64 as the queue drained |
| sanity afterwards | -- (server gone) | 8 / 8 |

Cause: `LayerCache._align_bufs` kept the align outputs of the fused LRU kernel per (rows, block) per layer, for good,
so that a captured graph would find them at the same address. But a prefill chunk shares the step's token budget
with whatever is decoding, so under real traffic nearly every eager step has a size nobody has seen, and each new
size left 28 MiB per rank behind (two 73k-entry int32 tables x 48 layers at a 4,096-token chunk). Every benchmark
here uses fixed prompt depths and a handful of shapes; none could show it. It has been there since the fused LRU
path went in, so v0.1.0 and v0.2.0 have it too. Fix: ONE buffer set per layer, sized by the largest step seen (in
serving the first call is vLLM's profile run at max_num_batched_tokens) and handed out as views; the fused kernel
rewrites every entry it hands back, so sharing is safe and the addresses a captured graph replays through never
move. If a larger step ever arrives the old set is kept and one twice the size takes over. (A first version kept
buffers only during graph capture and used temporaries otherwise; it soaked clean too, and was dropped for the
simpler scheme.) `tests/test_cache_shapes.py`: 900 eager shapes smallest-first hold five sets and under 100 KiB at
test scale; largest-first nothing grows and the address is one throughout; a captured graph replays 12 new routings
equal to an eager twin, also with eager steps of another size in between. The plugin's other shape-keyed caches
(`_MX_TABLES`, the QSA scratch, the staging area) are bounded by construction.

A longer and rougher soak of the fix (16 clients for 31 minutes, prompts of 270 to 28.5k tokens, so the queue
fills and drains continually): 291 served, 0 failed, sanity 8 / 8, VRAM at the same 31.64 GiB plateau from the
third minute to the end.

**The same soak on four cards** (TP4, everything in VRAM, the expert cache not in use): 236 served, 0 failed, 5
rejected for length, sanity 8 / 8, VRAM flat at 31.96 GiB per card for the whole run. First long-context soak of
the headline configuration; nothing found.

**UTIL=0.96: rejected.** With the leak fixed it ran 15 minutes at 32,555 MiB of 32,624 and died on a 150 MiB
allocation when the queue drained (82 served, 7 failed). The step the 0.94 run takes at the same moment is 640 MiB,
which 0.94 has (983 MiB free at the peak) and 0.96 does not. The 28% of extra KV is not available on this card.

**Rule from here on:** a release is soaked with mixed-length prompts on both configurations before it is tagged.
Fixed-depth benchmarks measure speed; they cannot see what accumulates.

### 2026-10-02: garbled answers on two cards -- a race in our own all-reduce

**Found by accident, by the sanity check.** After a prefill benchmark on the leak-fix build the 8-way sanity came
back 7 / 8 with `'45 Engine En'` and `'5 Engine Eng'`: the right digits, then one token (7943, " Engine") instead of
the end of the answer, for good. Every sanity before it had been a clean 8 / 8 -- and that check counts an answer
right if the number appears anywhere in it. `bench/sanity_stress.py` (new) asks the same questions strictly, in
rounds, optionally after long prefills, and prints every bad answer.

**It was not the leak fix** (all three buffer schemes showed it: 2 / 800, 2 / 800, 1 / 800 answers, always in the
first 8-way batch after a long prompt, always a late sequence) **and not the insert threshold** (3 of 60 rounds at
0.5, always the eighth request). The eighth request was the clue: with `NSEQ=8` a long request that has not left
yet makes the eighth of eight wait one step, and it then joins a batch of running decodes. Submitting more requests
than `max_num_seqs` does that on every round, with no long prompt at all:

| Flash-Next TP2 + offload, NSEQ=8, strict sanity | rounds with a bad answer | bad answers |
|---|---|---|
| 8 concurrent | 0 / 100 | 0 / 800 |
| 9 concurrent | 34 / 100 | 74 / 900 |
| 12 concurrent | 41 / 100 | 57 / 1,200 |
| 16 concurrent | 34 / 100 | 64 / 1,600 |

One knob per launch from there (9 concurrent x 100 rounds / 12 x 60; rounds with a bad answer):

| leg | 9 conc | 12 conc | |
|---|---|---|---|
| defaults | 34 | 41 (of 100) | |
| TP4, NSEQ=16 at 16 / 17 / 24 / 32 concurrent | 0 | 0 | 0 of 7,620 answers |
| TP4, NSEQ=8 | 0 | 0 | not the sequence limit as such |
| `EAGER=1` (no HIP graphs) | 0 | 0 | needs graph replay |
| GDN decode stock / all five decode fusions stock | 1 / 0 | 34 / 35 | not our decode kernels |
| `R9K_AR_QUANT=0` (exact all-reduce only) | 25 | 29 | not the compressed codec |
| `R9K_LRU_FUSED=0` | 8 | 6 | not the fused LRU kernel |
| a sparser capture-size list | **99** | **60 of 60** | deterministic: it is about how a mixed batch is padded and sized |
| GPUs 0,1 (one PLX switch) | 26 | 27 | not the card pair |
| no speculation (`MTP=` as an argument) | 0 | 0 | the draft passes supply the differently-sized messages |
| **RCCL all-reduce (`R9K_R4D_AR=0`)** | **0** | **0** | |
| **libr4d all-reduce (`R9K_AR_IMPL=r4d`)** | **0** | **0** | |
| Qwen3.8-27B, TP2, `serve/27b.sh` | 8 | 0 | the 27B has it too |

**The bug** (`kernels/r9k_ar.hip`, ours, the TP2 default since 2026-09-22). Each rank pushes its input into the
peer's scratch and sums the pair; the scratch is double-buffered so that a rank already on the next call cannot
overwrite what its peer is still reading. The half was chosen by `seq[b] & 1`, a counter PER BLOCK, and the launch
grid was the number of data blocks, which follows the message size (`n16 // 1400`, 4..24). A block that sat out a
small message kept its old parity, so on the next, larger message it wrote into the SAME half as the message
before -- and its slice starts inside that message's tail whenever the new slices are shorter (`per' * nb_prev <
n16_prev`: e.g. 28 rows = 6 blocks of 1,494 words, then 58 rows = 13 blocks of 1,428: block 6 starts at word 8,568
of a message that ends at 8,960). A rank one call ahead then overwrote the last rows of the previous message before
the other rank had summed them. From that step the two ranks disagreed on the hidden state of the LAST sequence in
the batch, and it decoded garbage for the rest of its life. The compressed path made it worse in a second way: it
shared the scratch with the exact path but kept its own counters, so the two paths could pick the same half for
consecutive calls at any time. It takes two back-to-back all-reduces of different sizes with the ranks slightly out
of step: the MTP draft passes next to a main forward whose size has just changed because a prompt joined, under graph
replay, where launches are microseconds apart. In lockstep it never shows, which is why every test passed (the
kernel's own test even exercised "a varying block count between calls" -- with a sync after each).

**The fix.** Every call advances every counter: the launch grid is fixed per (scratch, counters) pair (24 blocks at
TP2; 16 one-shot and 64 two-shot at TP4) and blocks beyond the data blocks do nothing but increment. All blocks
then agree on the half, which is what double buffering assumed all along; the 2-rank compressed path now uses the
exact path's counters. New entry points `r9k_ar_*_g(..., grid)`; the old ones remain for tests that keep one block
count. The N-rank kernels had the same per-block scheme (TP4 never showed it; its one-shot path has a constant
block count and its two-shot path varies only above ~40 tokens) and got the same fix.

`tests/test_ar_race.py` (torchrun, 2 ranks): one captured graph of small-then-larger pairs, replayed 1,500 times
with rank 1 held back. Old grid: 3 exact outputs wrong with every message exact, 6,008 wrong and 6,000 differing
between the ranks with the compressed path on. Fixed grid: 0 and 0. `test_ar_r9k`, `test_ar_nrank`, `test_ar4`
pass; the idle blocks cost nothing measurable (4-rank graph timings identical to the microsecond-level table).

**Serving, after the fix** (strict sanity, requests over `max_num_seqs`): TP2 + offload with the sparse capture list
0 of 1,620 (was 99 / 100 rounds); TP2 defaults 0 of 4,600 at 9 / 12 / 16 concurrent and 0 of 320 in the long-prompt
pattern; 27B 0 of 3,900; TP4 0 of 6,020. Probes unchanged on all three.

**What was affected.** Any two-card run on our all-reduce -- Flash-Next TP2 + offload and the 27B at TP2 -- from
2026-09-22 (v0.1.0) on, whenever a request joined a batch already in flight: more requests than `max_num_seqs`, or
requests arriving while others decode. One sequence of the batch, a few percent of the time. v0.2.1's `NSEQ=8`
made it common by letting eight run. Every quality eval here ran at concurrency 1 and could not see it; BetterBench
does not read answers. Four cards: no wrong answer in 15,000, but the same construction, now fixed.
On v0.2.0 / v0.2.1, `R9K_R4D_AR=0` (RCCL all-reduce) avoids it.

**Rules from this.** (1) The sanity check is strict now and part of every benchmark chain. (2) A release is
stressed at more requests than `max_num_seqs` and soaked with mixed lengths, on every configuration. (3) "Passes in
lockstep" is not evidence about a handshake; a protocol test must put the ranks out of step.

### 2026-10-02: out of memory on four cards under mixed-length concurrency -- the PLE short-conv prefill

**Found by the release soak.** The first validation pass of v0.2.2 ran BetterBench, the strict stress and a
mixed-length soak on every configuration. Four cards passed the first two (159.2 tok/s, 0 bad answers of 4,900) and
died in the third: 24 clients, prompts of 200 to 30k tokens, `NSEQ=16` -- 31 requests served, VRAM from 29.4 to
32.2 GiB in 40 seconds, `torch.OutOfMemoryError` on a 156 MiB allocation. The earlier four-card soak (8 clients,
all long prompts) had sat at 31.96 GiB and passed.

The allocation is in `ple/short_conv.py`, our drop-in for vLLM's `_short_conv_dilated_prefill_batched`, and the
cause is in the algorithm we mirror: it packs ALL prefills of a step into `[prefills, longest, 4*hidden]` and keeps
about six tensors of that size alive (zeros, transposed, history, conv output, activation, transposed back). One
long chunk next to many short prompts is therefore many times the step's real tokens. vLLM's memory profile runs
one sequence and sees 84 MiB per tensor; nothing budgets for the product.

| one step holds | stock: peak in this function | packed by length |
|---|---|---|
| 3,800 + 7 x 40 tokens | 3,055 MiB | 526 MiB |
| 3,000 + 15 x 70 tokens | 4,779 MiB | 432 MiB |
| 2,900 + 800 + 300 + 17 + 5 tokens (+ decode rows) | 1,498 MiB | 419 MiB |
| 3,000 + 900 + 60 tokens, one NULL state block | 958 MiB | 430 MiB |

**Fix:** group the step's prefills by length, longest first, each group at most 1.25x the step's own token count
(`R9K_PLE_CONV_SLACK`; a single sequence is always a group, so one prefill or prefills of similar length run exactly
as before, without the host sync the grouping needs). Each sequence's convolution reads only its own tokens and its
own state, so the output and the written-back conv state are the same bits: `tests/test_ple_conv.py` compares both
with stock on five skewed cases and bounds the peak.

It also explains two loose ends on two cards: the one-time +640 MiB step in the soaks of the leak fix (the first
step with several prefills of different lengths), and why `UTIL=0.96` died "when the queue drained" (the same step,
with 69 MiB free). Every release has had it -- through vLLM's own method in v0.1.0, through our override since
v0.2.0 -- on any configuration; four cards at 16 running sequences reach it first because they admit the most
prefills per step.

### 2026-10-02: v0.2.2 validated -- the checks every release gets from now on

On the release code (151 source files checksummed against the commit), every configuration: the 26 single-GPU gates
and the all-reduce suites (`test_ar_race` on both card pairs, `test_ar_r9k`, `test_ar_nrank`, `test_ar4`); then per
configuration a full BetterBench (20 passes), the 8-way sanity, the strict stress at more requests than
`max_num_seqs`, a mixed-length soak with VRAM at 1 Hz, and the strict stress after long prompts.

| | Flash-Next TP2 + offload | Flash-Next TP4 | 27B TP2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| decode / step p50 / TTFT p50 | 97.4 tok/s / 25.61 ms / 483 ms | 157.3 / 16.81 / 97 | 197.5 / 23.46 / 114 |
| prefill 2k / 8k / 16k / 32k | 2,210 / 3,558 / 3,839 / 3,800 | 6,476 / 7,348 / 7,445 / 7,180 | 4,190 / 4,191 / 4,072 / 3,837 |
| concurrency 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 | 87 / 109 / 116 / 116 / 116 | 151 / 239 / 355 / 473 / 624 | 174 / 280 / 413 / 519 |
| the release before | 97.4 / 25.62 / 484; 87-109-116-118-113 | 159.2 / 16.79 / 94; 151-231-350-478-635 | 196.6 / 23.43 / 116; 174-287-401-526 |
| strict stress over `max_num_seqs` | 0 bad of 2,500 (9, 16 conc) | 0 of 4,900 (17, 32) | 0 of 2,100 (9, 12) |
| mixed-length soak | 16 clients, 26 min: 230 served, 0 failed | 24 clients, 15 min: 450 / 0; 16 long-context clients, 10 min: 165 / 0 | 12 clients, 15 min: 232 / 0 |
| VRAM peak in the soak (of 32,624 MiB) | 30,948 | 30,210 | 32,505, once (see below) |
| strict stress after long prompts | 0 of 160 | 0 of 160 | 0 of 160 |
| sanity | 8 / 8 | 8 / 8 | 8 / 8 |

Speed is the release before's on all three, to within the run-to-run band. The short-conv packing took 0.7 GiB off
the two-card soak peak (31,640 -> 30,948: the one-time step is gone) and 1.75 GiB off four cards' (31,957 with only
eight clients -> 30,210 with twenty-four). Open after this: the 27B reached 32,505 MiB once during its soak before
torch trimmed its cache back to 28.3 GiB -- no error, but `KVMEM=9` leaves it little room; and
`tests/test_ar_quant.py` is a libr4d-backend test that spawns its own ranks and must not be run under torchrun.

### 2026-10-02: Qwen3.8-27B on two cards, a same-day baseline against the reference stack

Same two cards (GPUs 0,1, one PLX switch), same checkpoint, full BetterBench each, both sanity 8 / 8. Ours:
`serve/27b.sh` on vLLM 0.30. Reference: GGZ14 radiance 0.9.3 (vLLM 0.27.1), relaunched with `~/launch-ref27b.sh`.

| | ours | reference | |
|---|---|---|---|
| decode | 196.6 tok/s | 197.5 | 99.5% |
| step p50 | 23.43 ms | 23.15 | +1.2% |
| TTFT p50 | 116 ms | 65 | 1.8x slower |
| prefill 2k / 8k / 16k / 32k | 4,177 / 4,187 / 4,066 / 3,832 | 4,780 / 4,947 / 4,903 / 4,746 | 87 / 85 / 83 / 81% |
| concurrency 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 | 174 / 287 / 401 / 526 | 180 / 303 / 428 / 558 | 97 / 95 / 94 / 94% |
| KV cache | 210,782 tokens | 798,784 | 3.8x smaller |

Decode is at parity. What is left: prefill (the reference chunks at 8,192 and runs libr4d's all-reduce), time to
first token (prefill graphs up to 2,048 tokens took Flash-Next from 137 to 104 ms and have not been tried here),
concurrency, and KV capacity (ours is a fixed `KVMEM=9`; theirs is profiled at 0.95 and, by its size, 8-bit).

### 2026-10-02: time to first token -- the GDN prefill core (after v0.2.2, on master)

The 27B answered a short prompt in ~97 ms against the reference's 46, and on 2026-09-21 this log closed that as
upstream behaviour. It was not. Reopened with three measurements, each narrower than the last:

1. **TTFT against prompt length** (`~/pfsweep2.py`): ours 96 / 96 / 144 / 144 / 175 ms at 44 / 82 / 158 / 319 / 655
   tokens, the reference 46 / 67 / 94 / 130 / 163. Flat in the prompt length: a fixed cost, not compute. Prefill
   graphs up to 2,048 tokens (`CGSIZES`) moved only the 158-319 range (to 96 / 121) and cost 0.8 GiB; prefix caching
   off changed nothing. Neither is the cause.
2. **The server's own counters** (`bench/ttft_breakdown.py`): queue 0.0 ms, one engine iteration per request, and
   that one step ~90 ms where a decode step is 23-28. The reference: one step, 40 ms.
3. **A torch profile of that step with Python stacks**: 48 calls of `r9700::gdn_core`, each falling through to
   stock's prefill core -- `fused_post_conv_prep`, the chunked delta rule (`chunk_gated_delta_rule`: cumsum, KK^T,
   triangular solve, W/U, the state scan, the output: six Triton kernels), state gather and scatter, the gated norm.
   ~30 launches and 1.15 ms of wall per layer in a unit bench, the same at 16 tokens and at 2,048. 48 layers: ~55
   ms of a 97 ms step. The op runs eagerly between the pieces of the piecewise graph, so no capture size helps.

**The fix** (`kernels/r9k_gdn.hip`, `r9700_vllm/models/gdn.py`): for a step with few prefill tokens, the recurrence
token by token in one launch per layer -- `r9k_gdn_seq`, the decode kernel's loop with the state in registers,
any number of tokens, the final state stored once -- after the causal conv in one launch, `r9k_gdn_conv`. Both read
and write the batch's own rows through a row map, so a step that mixes prefills with running spec-decode sequences
needs no gather either (their half goes through the same kernel in its decode form; only stock's conv update still
gathers its input).

What the unit test holds (`tests/test_gdn_prefill_r9k.py`):
- against an fp64 token-by-token reference the output differs only in bf16 rounding flips (19-318 of 10^5-10^6
  elements), relative error 1-6e-5; **stock's chunked form sits at 5e-3 from the same reference** (state 3e-3). The
  chunked form does its solves on bf16 q/k; token by token in fp32 is simply closer to the definition.
- spec-decode sequences through the new kernel are bit-identical to `r9k_gdn_decode_mtp`; row-mapped runs are
  bit-identical to compact ones.
- the conv is bit-identical to stock's, output and state. That took finding out what stock computes: the Triton
  kernel multiplies bf16 by bf16, and on this backend the fp32 -> bf16 conversion inside that multiply
  **truncates** (the final store rounds to nearest). Half the outputs differed by an ulp until the products were
  truncated; found by enumerating the rounding choices against stock's output. Kept, because the decode-side conv
  is the same Triton arithmetic and the two should agree.

**It is not free on the GPU.** Unit bench, one sequence, Hv 24: stock 1.12 ms per layer at any length; ours 0.04 /
0.09 / 0.24 / 0.48 / 0.95 / 1.77 ms at 16 / 45 / 128 / 256 / 512 / 1,024 tokens (~1.8 us per token; the conv 0.03-0.15
against 0.42). In serving the crossover comes earlier than those numbers say, because stock's Python overlaps with
GPU work already queued: the step is max(launch time, GPU time), and once it is GPU-bound our extra 0.065-0.086 ms
per token (36 / 48 layers) is pure loss.

| first token, ms (client median) | 45 | 83 | 159 | 197 | 236 | 278 | 320 | 404 | 509 | 656 tokens |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 27B TP2, stock core | 99 | 98 | 148 | | | 148 | 148 | 148 | 150 | 172 |
| 27B TP2, ours at every length <= 512 | 49 | 61 | 81 | 85 | 92 | 122 | 128 | 142 | **161** | 172 |
| reference stack | 46 | 68 | 93 | | | | 125 | | | 158 |
| Flash-Next TP4, stock core | 87 | 87 | 88 | 87 | 88 | 91 | 92 | 107 | 112 | 131 |
| Flash-Next TP4, ours <= 256 | 44 | 58 | 73 | 82 | 87 | 90 | 91 | 107 | 112 | 132 |
| Flash-Next TP4, ours <= 512 (first try) | 46 | 60 | 74 | | | | **107** | | | 132 |

So the threshold (`R9K_GDN_PREFILL_MAX`, prefill tokens per step) is 256 by default -- Flash-Next on four cards
breaks even there -- and `serve/27b.sh` sets 400 (the 27B breaks even near 440). Flash-Next on two cards (offload,
no prefill graphs): 52 ms at 44 tokens; above its graph limit it runs eagerly as before (177 ms at 82 tokens).

Checked, in place of the release checklist (Brian's call: publish without the full suite): seven unit gates;
strict sanity with more requests than `max_num_seqs`, 100 rounds after short prefills and 10 after long ones, on
all three configurations, 0 bad answers of 3,850 (run at threshold 512, the wider coverage); three concurrency
probes per launch on Flash-Next TP4 with and without (c16 884-887 against 866-880: no change -- one early probe
that read 774 was a first-probe-after-launch number). **Not run:** GSM8K, a full BetterBench, the mixed-length soak.
The smoke test earned its keep once: with speculative decoding the conv state is wider than the conv's three
columns (the conv update's rolling window lives in the same tensor), the wrapper asserted exactly three, and the
server died at warm-up. The unit test now has that case.

What is left in a short first step (profile with stacks, 27B, 45 tokens, so every number is inflated ~1.7x):
GDN metadata built once per KV-cache group, 11 times, 14 ms (stock; the reference patches vLLM to share it); the
GDN layers still 0.6 ms each, most of it stock's conv launcher at the time (since replaced); the KV-cache update of
the 16 attention layers 6 ms; the drafter 4 ms.

### 2026-10-02: UTIL=0.96 on two cards, retested and adopted

Brian's question: could 0.96 work now that the other bugs are fixed? It was rejected on 2026-10-01 after the leak
fix but before the short-conv packing fix, and the allocation it died on (150 MiB with 69 MiB free, "when the
queue drained") was that third bug. Never retested since. Flash-Next TP2, GPUs 0,2, offload, master 7806509:

| | UTIL=0.94 | UTIL=0.96 |
|---|--:|--:|
| KV cache, first (compiling) launch | 95,429 tokens | 128,772 |
| KV cache, restarted launch | 121,299 | 155,791 (+28%) |
| VRAM, first launch, both soaks | | 30,376 -> 30,396 MiB, flat |
| VRAM, restarted launch, mixed soak | 30,400 -> 30,948 (25 min) | 31,066 -> 31,350 (first 5.7 min) |

First launch at 0.96: the soak that killed it (8 clients, 18k-30k tokens, 956 s) 86 served, 11 rejected for
length, 0 errors; mixed (16 clients, 200-30k tokens, 1,563 s) 227 served, 11 rejected, 0 errors; strict sanity
after 24k-token prefills 0 bad of 180; sanity 8 / 8; probe 117.0 tok/s, c8 188, prefill 8k 2,622 (speed unchanged).
The first launch has the smaller pool, so the case people run -- restarted -- was started as a short check and
**stopped at 5.7 minutes of the mixed soak on Brian's instruction (no more tests)**: peak 31,350 of 32,624 MiB
(1,274 free), no OOM or HIP error line, no request summary. At 0.94 all of the soak's growth came in its first
minute, which is why a short burst was the check; a full-length soak of the restarted launch is still owed.
Adopted as the default for TP2 with offload only (`serve/serve.sh`; `UTIL=0.94` restores).

### Next
State at v0.2.0 (Flash-Next TP4, full BetterBench, vs Rob's image on the same box): decode +19%, step -18%, TTFT
1.5x, prefill +18..+29%, concurrency +12..+20%. What is left, in the order it looks worth doing:
1. ~~Per-fusion quality evals against a bit-reproducible baseline~~ -- done 2026-09-29, section above: no fusion
   costs accuracy on the full test set.
2. **Decode node count**: the stock MoE align / top-k / sum glue (~250 graph nodes per step at ~1.5 us of dispatch
   each), then the remaining GDN and spec-decode glue.
3. **Split-V GDN core** for high concurrency (at 16 sequences the fused kernel is state-bandwidth bound).
4. Compressed all-reduce: pipelining message halves across the local link and the uplink (~5% long prefill).
5. Prefill tail, each ~1% of a chunk: `hc_gate_mix`, a WMMA fp8-block GEMM for prefill widths, the `copyBuffer`
   device copies and the stock per-token quant of the block GEMM.
6. **First step, what is left** (2026-10-02): take the gated norm out of the token loop of `r9k_gdn_seq` (three
   block syncs per token; a second pass over the tokens needs none) -- a faster token would move the threshold
   past 256 / 400 and reach the 300-1,000-token prompts, where the 27B still trails the reference by 5-10%; the
   GDN metadata built once per KV group (stock, ~14 ms of a profiled step); the conv update in mixed steps.
7. **`UTIL=0.96` on two cards** is the default since 2026-10-02; the restarted launch has only a 5.7-minute
   soak behind it. Run the full mixed soak on a restarted launch before the next tag.

### Open questions for Brian
- v0.2.3 (the short-prefill GDN core, UTIL=0.96 on two cards) was tagged on 2026-10-02 on a smoke test, by
  Brian's decision ("no need to run full validation suite", "no need for a full GSM8K set"). Owed with the next
  release: a quality eval (short prompts take a numerically different, more exact path), a full BetterBench on
  the three configurations, the mixed soak on a restarted 0.96 launch.
- The published v0.2.0 and v0.2.1 notes say nothing of either bug. Edit them on GitHub, or let v0.2.2's notes
  carry it?
- Prefix caching is off by default for Flash-Next (`PREFIX_CACHE=1` restores cross-request prefix reuse): a
  serving-behaviour change, right for benchmarks and one-shot prompts, wrong for long multi-turn sessions.
