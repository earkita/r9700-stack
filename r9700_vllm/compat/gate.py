"""Version gate for the plugin's remaining monkeypatches.

Every patch that reaches into a vLLM internal (rather than an extension point) is listed here with the vLLM
commit(s) it was written and tested against. On any other vLLM it still installs if its target is present
(each patch is written to self-disable once upstream behaves), but logs a warning so a pin bump re-tests it.
tests/test_integration.py asserts each patch's target still exists.
